# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session — Orient First

Before doing anything else:

1. **Search QMD** for what you were last working on:
   - `memory_search("what was I working on")`
   - `memory_search("pending actions")`
2. **Read daily notes** — `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)
3. **If post-compaction** — read `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and follow every step before touching files
4. **Main session only** — `MEMORY.md` is for private sessions with Paul (not groups or shared contexts)

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened each day
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated facts, decisions, and lessons (main session only)

### 📝 Write It Down — No Mental Notes

Memory dies at compaction. If you want to remember it, write it to a file.

- "Remember this" → update `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- New lesson or decision → update `MEMORY.md`
- Mistake you shouldn't repeat → document it

### 🔄 Memory Maintenance

Every few days (during heartbeats): review recent daily files, distill anything worth keeping into `MEMORY.md`, and prune stale entries. Daily files = raw notes. MEMORY.md = curated wisdom.

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- `trash` > `rm` — recoverable beats gone forever
- When in doubt, ask.

## External vs Internal

**Do freely:** read files, search the web, check calendars, work within the workspace.

**Ask first:** sending emails or posts, anything leaving the machine, anything you're uncertain about.

# Amazon Book Sales Intelligence Report
## 'The Divided Brain: Behavioral Psychology for Better Decision Making' by Paul Larche
**Research Date:** March 1, 2026  
**Prepared for:** Paul Larche Book Promotion Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The behavioral psychology/decision-making book market on Amazon remains highly competitive in 2026, dominated by perennial classics like Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow* and Cialdini's *Influence*. However, emerging algorithm changes (A10 rollout), evolving reader search behavior, and underserved sub-niches present strategic opportunities for *The Divided Brain* to gain visibility and market share.

**Key Finding:** The 2026 Amazon A10 algorithm now heavily weights engagement signals (click-through rate, time on page, conversion) over pure sales velocity, creating an opening for well-optimized mid-list titles to compete with established bestsellers.

---

## 1. CATEGORY OPPORTUNITIES

### Current Amazon Category Landscape

Amazon's 2026 category system now limits new books to **3 browse categories** (down from the previous 10-category system). Category selection has become more critical than ever.

### Recommended Primary Categories for *The Divided Brain*

| Category | Competition Level | #1 BSR Threshold | Strategic Value |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Medical Books > Psychology > Behavioral Psychology** | High | ~2,500-5,000 overall | Primary category - high authority but competitive |
| **Business & Money > Skills > Decision-Making & Problem Solving** | Medium-High | ~5,000-8,000 overall | Core target - better visibility opportunity |
| **Medical Books > Psychology > Cognitive Psychology** | Medium | ~3,000-6,000 overall | Less saturated than behavioral psych |
| **Self-Help > Personal Transformation > Personal Growth** | Very High | ~1,000-3,000 overall | High traffic but difficult to rank |
| **Science & Math > Biological Sciences > Neuroscience** | Low-Medium | ~10,000-20,000 overall | **Untapped opportunity** |

### Strategic Category Recommendations

**Better Placement Than Current (if applicable):**

1. **Add Neuroscience angle** - The "Neuroscience" category has significantly lower competition (BSR thresholds 2-4x higher) and growing reader interest. Reframe positioning to emphasize the brain science/hemisphere research foundation.

2. **Business Decision-Making subcategory** - Often overlooked by pure psychology books. Readers here have purchase intent and price tolerance ($15-25 range).

3. **Consumer Behavior** - Under the Business & Money umbrella, this niche has fewer competing titles than general behavioral psychology while capturing marketing/business readers.

### 2026 Category Tactics

- **Use BISAC codes strategically**: The 3-category limit applies to browse categories, but correct BISAC codes can get you into additional search indexes
- **Monitor category BSR daily**: Tools like Publisher Rocket or BookBeam track which categories have the lowest #1 bestseller threshold
- **Request category changes post-launch**: Contact KDP support with sales momentum to request additional categories after 30+ days of sales data

Amazon quietly replaced the A9 algorithm with **A10** starting in May 2025, with full deployment by late 2025. This represents the most significant change to book discoverability in years.

### Key A10 Changes Affecting Non-Fiction Books

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** from search results: +40% weight increase

#### 2. **Metadata Quality Over Quantity**
- Book title keywords matter more than ever
- Subtitle optimization crucial for indexing
- Series consistency recognized and rewarded
- **Implication:** Front-load keywords in subtitle; maintain consistent branding

#### 3. **Customer Satisfaction Metrics**
- Review velocity (new reviews weighted more than total count)
- Return rates (lower = better ranking)
- Kindle Unlimited read-through rates
- **Implication:** Drive early reviews aggressively; ensure quality to minimize returns

#### 4. **Prime and FBA Preference Reduced for Books**
- Unlike physical products, Prime eligibility now has **neutral** weight for books

- **Implication:** KDP Print is now competitive with traditional publishing for ranking

#### 5. **Amazon Advertising Integration**
- Sponsored Products ads now influence organic rank indirectly through sales velocity

## 6. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

### RECOMMENDATION #1: Implement Aggressive Review Generation Campaign

**The Problem:** A10 algorithm heavily weights review velocity. *The Divided Brain* needs 25+ reviews in first 30 days to trigger algorithmic visibility.

**Implementation:**
1. **Pre-launch ARC team:** Recruit 50-100 behavioral psychology enthusiasts, business book bloggers, LinkedIn followers
   - Source from: Paul's LinkedIn network, relevant subreddits (r/behavioraleconomics, r/decisionmaking), Goodreads groups
   - Deliver ARCs 3-4 weeks before launch
   - Follow up twice (1 week before, day of launch)

2. **Launch week promotion:**
   - Price at $0.99 for first 5 days (maximize unit velocity)
   - Email list blast (if available)
   - LinkedIn announcement with direct Amazon link
   - Ask ARC readers to post reviews within 48 hours of launch

3. **Review monitoring:**
   - Use tool like BookReport or ReaderScout to track new reviews
   - Respond professionally to all reviews (especially critical ones)
   - Report any policy violations promptly

**Expected Outcome:** 30-50 reviews in first month, triggering A10 algorithm boost for organic visibility.

---

### RECOMMENDATION #2: Launch Amazon Ads Campaign with Strategic Keyword Bidding

**The Problem:** Organic visibility is difficult without initial sales momentum. Targeted advertising can drive both immediate sales and organic rank improvement.

**Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Research (Week 1)**
- Use Publisher Rocket or Helium 10 to identify 50-100 relevant keywords
- Target: Kahneman, Cialdini, Ariely book titles; "behavioral psychology," "decision making," "cognitive bias"
- Competitive titles: *Thinking Fast and Slow*, *Influence*, *Nudge*, *Predictably Irrational*

**Phase 2: Campaign Structure (Week 2)**
Create three ad groups:

| Ad Group | Keywords | Bid Strategy | Budget |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Brand Defense** | "Divided Brain," "Paul Larche" | $0.50-0.75 CPC | $10/day |
| **Competitor Targeting** | Kahneman, Cialdini, Ariely titles | $1.00-1.50 CPC | $20/day |
| **Category Discovery** | Broad: behavioral psychology, decision making | $0.75-1.00 CPC | $15/day |

**Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)**
- Review search term report weekly
- Add negative keywords for irrelevant searches
- Increase bids on ACOS < 40% keywords
- Pause keywords with >$5 spend, 0 sales

**Expected Outcome:** 20-50 daily clicks, 3-8% conversion rate, ACOS target 50-70% (acceptable for launch/visibility phase). This drives algorithmic visibility that persists after ad spend reduces.

---

### RECOMMENDATION #3: Optimize Categories and Keywords for Neuroscience/Business Crossover

**The Problem:** Current positioning may be too narrow in pure behavioral psychology, competing directly with established bestsellers. Pivoting to emphasize the brain science foundation and business application opens less competitive categories.

**Implementation:**

1. **Category Optimization:**
   - **Primary:** Medical Books > Psychology > Cognitive Psychology (less competitive than Behavioral Psychology)
   - **Secondary:** Business & Money > Skills > Decision-Making & Problem Solving (commercial intent)
   - **Tertiary:** Science & Math > Biological Sciences > Neuroscience (emerging interest, lower competition)

2. **Keyword Update (KDP Backend):**
   ```
   Line 1: brain science decision making hemisphere theory
   Line 2: neuroscience psychology business leadership
   Line 3: left brain right brain practical guide
   Line 4: cognitive psychology everyday decisions
   Line 5: behavioral economics mental models
   Line 6: consumer psychology marketing influence
   Line 7: thinking fast slow similar book
   ```

3. **Description Rewrite (First 100 characters critical for A10):**
   ```
   Discover how your brain's two hemispheres control every decision you make. The Divided Brain reveals the neuroscience behind better choices in business and life—combining cutting-edge brain research with practical behavioral psychology strategies used by top performers.
   ```

4. **Subtitle A/B Test:**
   - Option A: "Behavioral Psychology for Better Decision Making" (current)
   - Option B: "How Brain Science Transforms Your Decision Making" (neuroscience angle)
   - Test via Amazon Ads click-through rates

**Expected Outcome:** Improved discoverability in less competitive categories, differentiation from Kahneman/Cialdini, access to business reader segment with higher price tolerance.

## 1. CATEGORY OPPORTUNITIES

### Current Situation
The book is currently positioned in:
- Consumer Behavior
- Applied Psychology  
- Decision-Making

### Research Findings

**High-Opportunity, Lower-Competition Categories:**

Based on Kindlepreneur and BookBloom research (Nov 2025 - Feb 2026), Amazon KDP now limits category additions, making initial selection critical. Key opportunities identified:

| Category Path | Opportunity Level | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Business & Money > Consumer Behavior > Neuromarketing | HIGH | Low #1 BSR threshold; underserved niche |
| Medical Books > Psychology > Neuropsychology | HIGH | Academic crossover appeal |
| Self-Help > Personal Transformation > Personal Growth | MEDIUM | Broader reach, higher competition |
| Science & Math > Biological Sciences > Neuroscience | MEDIUM | Positions as science-based authority |
| Business & Money > Skills > Decision Making & Problem Solving | HIGH | Direct alignment; emerging category |

**Critical Insight:** Categories with #1 bestseller ranks between 100,000-500,000 ABSR (Amazon Best Seller Rank) offer the best "low-hanging fruit" opportunity. Mass-market psychology categories often require ABSR < 5,000 to hit #1.

**Recommendation:** Add "Medical Books > Psychology" and "Business & Money > Skills > Decision Making" as additional browse categories via KDP support if possible, or prioritize in the 2 initial selections.

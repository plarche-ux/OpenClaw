# MOCHA Framework

**Origin:** Paul Larche — developed during radio/media career
**Type:** Customer experience flywheel
**Core purpose:** Create passionate customers who go out of their way to convert others

> *"MOCHA is our 'why' — it's a state of mind in our company."*

## The Flywheel

MOCHA is not a checklist. It's a loop. Each stage feeds the next, building compounding momentum — the flywheel effect.

```
MAKE → OUR CUSTOMERS → HAPPY → ALWAYS → (back to MAKE)
```

---

## M — Make

*Internal foundation. You can't deliver for customers until you have the right people, strategy, and mindset.*

- Persistent pro-activity
- Right strategy + strategic plan
- Measurable goals
- Big picture thinking
- Right people — PLU (Values). Everything else can be learned.
- Encourage individual strengths
- Will to Win: winner attitude, be the best, will to grow, pay the price

---

## O — Our

*Define exactly who your customers are. Not assumptions — clarity.*

Three groups:
1. **Clients** — paying customers
2. **Community advocates** — influencers, partners, external champions
3. **Employees** — internal customers; they experience your culture first

> "Be mindful of stereotypes and perceptions."

---

## C — Customers

*See the world through their eyes. Understand what makes them tick.*

- Demographic intelligence
- Psychographic profiling
- Generational context
- What drives their decisions — emotionally and rationally
- Don't buy into perceptions or stereotypes — do the work

> "If you want to know why your customer buys what your customer buys, you have to see the world through your customer's eyes."

---

## H — Happy

*Emotion is the key. This is the whole game.*

- Connection is emotional before it is transactional
- Happy customers become advocates (the flywheel's output)
- The Old Brain decides — the New Brain rationalizes after

---

## A — Always

*Best practices, consistently applied — until you find a better way.*

- Encourage individual strengths
- Provide the tools
- MOCHA Magic Moments (create them deliberately)
- MOCHA Tragic Moments (learn from them, don't repeat them)
- Learn / Train / Practice / Certify
- Pay the price
- Measure through **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**

## Connection to The Divided Brain

MOCHA maps directly onto Old Brain / New Brain dynamics:

| MOCHA Stage | Brain Connection |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Make** | New Brain — rational planning, strategy, measurable goals |
| **Our / Customers** | Both — define rationally, empathize emotionally |
| **Happy** | Old Brain — emotion IS the decision. The New Brain writes the justification memo *after* the Old Brain says yes |
| **Always** | Old Brain habit loops + New Brain discipline and measurement |

**Sales angle (for John Golden / SPIN Selling context):**
SPIN Selling tells you *what to ask* to build logical justification. MOCHA tells you *who you're talking to* — and H is the whole game. Salespeople who understand the Old Brain stop selling features and start selling identity, belonging, and emotion. The logical case is for the customer to show their spouse. The emotional case is what closes the deal.

## Podcast / Speaking Talking Points

- "Emotion is not a soft skill in sales — it's the mechanism. MOCHA's H is where deals are won or lost."
- "Most salespeople are trained to sell to the New Brain. The Old Brain already made the decision — your job is not to interrupt it."
- "The flywheel only spins if H actually works. You can have great strategy and deep customer knowledge, but if the emotional experience is off, it stalls."
- "NPS is just the Old Brain's report card."

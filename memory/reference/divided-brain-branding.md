# The Divided Brain - Visual DNA & Branding Rules

To ensure visual consistency across all AI-generated content (LinkedIn, Dashboard, etc.), follow these non-negotiable rules based on the branding assets in the `DividedBrainReference` directory.

## 🧠 The Head & Face
- **Orientation:** The head/face silhouette must always point to the **LEFT**.
- **Style:** Clean, minimalist silhouette (white or light grey) with a transparent or high-contrast background.

## ⚙️ The Two Gears (Interlocked)
- **Concept:** The gears represent the relationship between the Old Brain (Emotional) and the New Brain (Logical).
- **Size Relationship:**
    - **Large Gear (Old Brain):** This must be the larger of the two gears.
    - **Small Gear (New Brain):** This must be the smaller gear.
- **Positioning:** The gears are interlocked inside the head silhouette, usually where the brain would be located.
- **Visual Weight:** The Large Gear should feel more "dominant" or "heavy" to reflect its evolutionary priority.

## 🎨 Color Palette
- **Primary:** High-contrast Black and White.
- **Accents:** Use accent colors sparingly (if at all) based on specific book chapters (e.g., Red for The Heart, Green for The Gut).
- **Style:** Professional, authoritative, and clinical yet accessible.

## 📐 Layout Constraints
- Maintain significant **white space** around the central imagery.
- Avoid cluttered or "busy" backgrounds.
- If text is included, use clean sans-serif typography.

## Completed Today

### System / Infrastructure
- [x] OpenClaw updated `v2026.2.22-2` → `v2026.2.23` via `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
- [x] Auto-update cron created: ID `9290284c-ee2d-4ee8-a711-b02f771098eb`, name "Auto-Update OpenClaw", schedule `0 3 * * *` America/New_York
- [x] `openclaw doctor --fix` run — legacy session keys canonicalized, session file permissions set to 600; removed invalid `sources: ["memory", "sessions"]` key from `memorySearch.experimental`
- [x] `openclaw security audit --fix` run — all session files hardened; 1 WARN remains (trusted proxies — benign for local Control UI)
- [x] Config applied: `agents.defaults.memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory = true`; `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled` already `true` (no change)
- [x] Gateway restarted post-config (stable on PID 94846 since 12:05 PM)
- [x] PM2 boot check passed: `brand-value-canvas` (:3000) and `mission-control` (:3001) both online

### Config Backup/Restore System Built
- Backup script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/backup-openclaw-config.sh`
- Restore script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/restore-openclaw-config.sh`
- Config safety skill: `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/config-safety/SKILL.md`
- Emergency restore instructions: `~/Desktop/RESTORE.txt`
- First backup committed to workspace git: `backups/openclaw.json.2026-02-24-1220`
- ⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Always run backup script before touching `openclaw.json` or restarting gateway

### Gateway Crash Post-Mortem
- Root causes: (1) `launchctl unsetenv` + manual restart conflicted with LaunchD KeepAlive → lock-contention loop; (2) Claude Code ran multiple rapid restarts compounding race condition; (3) invalid `sources` key in `memorySearch.experimental` caused config validation errors
- All resolved as of 12:05 PM

### Heartbeat Cycles Run
- 4:25 AM, ~6:30 AM, ~8:55 AM, 12:35 PM — QMD sync + embed ran successfully each time

## Email Flagged Today

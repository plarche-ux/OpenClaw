## Late Evening Session (8–10 PM)
- **qwen3:30b installed** via Ollama (18 GB, confirmed working)
- **MiniMax key replaced** — old key was invalid; new key saved to auth-profiles.json + openclaw.json
- **Model aliases restored** after bad edit wiped them: local-heavy=qwen3:30b, local-medium=qwen2.5:14b, triage=llama3.2:3b, kimi, sonnet, gemini-3.1, etc.
- **Cron routing updated:** Daily Memory Maintenance → ollama/qwen3:30b; Book Sales Intelligence → kimi-k2.5
- **Cron delivery fixed:** Added `"channel": "last"` + `bestEffort` to Morning Briefing & Memory crons

- **Config had multiple corruption cycles** due to bad alias edit; Paul + Claude fixed manually twice

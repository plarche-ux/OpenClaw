# Daily Notes: 2026-02-27

- Switched to Gemini 3.1 Pro per Paul's request.
- Performed a full project/task audit for book promotion, speaking gigs, and Barrie Cares.
- Updated `memory/tasks.json` (Mission Control) to align with Paul's goals.
- Changed Mission Control styling back to a light color scheme (`globals.css`).
- Spawned Link to fix Brand Value Canvas sidebar bleed, build the Mission Control Team page UI, and build the Mission Control Podcasts page.
- Spawned Trinity to draft the next LinkedIn post (Endowment Effect/Reciprocity) for Saturday.
- Spawned Niobe to research Christine Blosdale (Out of the Box podcast) for Paul's speaking opportunity.
- **Rule Update (Paul):** Any time Trinity drafts a new LinkedIn post, it MUST automatically be saved to `memory/linkedin-posts.json` with a "draft" status so it populates the Mission Control Drafts page. Do not just output it in chat.

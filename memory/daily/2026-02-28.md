## Summary
A heavy day for automated intelligence and system maintenance. Morpheus delivered the morning briefing, while Oracle and Niobe provided deep strategic insights for book promotion. Ghost completed the OpenClaw v2026.2.26 update.

## Activities & Findings
- **Morning Briefing:** Weather in Barrie (4°C) vs Fort Myers (80s, 40% rain). News focused on U.S./Israel strikes in Iran and a hypothetical American occupation of Canada. 10 unread emails summarized.
- **Book Sales Intelligence (Oracle):** Identified high-impact moves:
    - Expand categories to "Medical Books > Psychology" and "Business & Money > Skills > Decision Making."
    - Add backend keywords: `habit loop`, `neuroscience business`, `cognitive bias sales`, `why people buy`.
    - Price positioning: $16.99 (between James Clear and Robert Cialdini).
    - Strategy: Prioritize external traffic links (LinkedIn/Podcasts) to Amazon to boost A10 authority.
- **Research Bake-off (Niobe):** Audited behavioral sales landscape across 4 models.
    - **Winner:** Gemini 3.1 Pro for identifying modern rivals like Jeremy Miner (*The New Model of Selling*) and Renvoise & Morin (*The Persuasion Code*).
    - **Strategic Angle:** Position *The Divided Brain* as the "missing bridge" between academic theory (Kahneman) and sales-hacking frameworks.
- **System Update (Ghost):** OpenClaw updated to **v2026.2.26**.
    - New `openclaw secrets` workflow for safer key handling.
    - Better thread-bound agent lifecycle (Trinity/Niobe).
    - Android Node support (notifications/status monitoring).
    - Improved natural language "Stop" command handling.

## Decisions & Recommendations
- **Model Preference:** Gemini 3.1 Pro confirmed as the elite choice for competitive intelligence.
- **Android Integration:** Recommended pairing Paul's phone as a Node to monitor book sales and Barrie Cares alerts while mobile.
- **LinkedIn Strategy:** Next post should position *The Divided Brain* as the 2026 update to legacy behavioral frameworks (Niobe's bake-off insight).

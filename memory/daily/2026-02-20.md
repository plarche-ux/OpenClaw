# Daily Log: 2026-02-20

## Summary
- **System Stability:** Resolved a critical restart loop caused by a missing `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` in `openclaw.json`.
- **Search Fix:** Manually updated the Brave Search API key (removing a trailing underscore) and verified the gateway reloaded (PID 2854).
- **Model Migration:** Successfully switched the main session to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet (v4.6)** after fixing an authentication profile error (wrong key in `auth-profiles.json`).
- **Podcast Prep:** Generated a research briefing and PDF for Paul's 4:00 PM interview with John Gafford on "Escaping the Drift."

## Tasks
- [x] Check calendar via `gog` (Verified: Interview 4pm, Flight 6:20pm)
- [x] Check email summary (Found Streamyard link for interview)
- [ ] Review Amazon Ads performance (Pending)

## Notes
- **Gafford Interview Hook:** Using Streamyard ([link](https://streamyard.com/s6fvtiwmvj)).
- **Flight Info:** Paul's daughter is flying to Toronto (AC 1667) at 6:20 PM.
- **Technical Lesson:** When `gateway restart` is disabled, `pkill -HUP -f openclaw-gateway` or direct `kill -HUP <pid>` is required to reload config.

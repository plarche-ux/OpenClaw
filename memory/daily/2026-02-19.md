## 2026-02-19 - Morning Routine & Correction
- **Correction on Briefing:** Identified that the automated morning briefing (cron) delivered at 07:01 AM contained hallucinated/cached calendar events (WholeCEO Interview, 11 AM Sync, etc.).
- **Calendar Audit:** Performed a live check of Google Calendar via `gog` and confirmed only two real events for today:
    - **All Day:** Home (Working Location)
    - **10:00 AM – 11:30 AM:** Barrie Cares [In-person]
- **Technical Maintenance:** Resolved `PATH` issues preventing `gog` and `node` from running in the main session by explicitly pointing to `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node@22/22.22.0/bin/node`.
- **Note:** WholeCEO Interview was previously briefed for Feb 17; no current interview scheduled for today.

## 2026-02-18 - System Crisis & Recovery
- **Major Malfunction:** Encountered a ~1 hour breakdown due to a configuration crash loop. The trigger was an invalid `"path"` key added to `openclaw.json` during a manual skill registration attempt.
- **Recovery:** Paul restored the system using a stable `openclaw.json` from a GitHub backup.
- **Update:** Officially updated OpenClaw to **v2026.2.17** via `update.run` to provide native support for Claude Sonnet 4.6 and stabilize the configuration schema.
- **Amazon Ads Optimizer:** Successfully drafted the `amazon-ads-optimizer-skill.ts` including KENP (Kindle Edition Normalized Pages) tracking and "Old Brain" strategy rules. Registration pending final `openclaw doctor --fix` by user.
- **Safety Policy:** Re-committed to "One Thing At A Time" policy. No system changes will be made without explicit user "APPROVE" to prevent future crash loops.
- **Memory Backup:** Manual backup to GitHub (`plarche-ux/OpenClaw`) performed before deep diagnostics.

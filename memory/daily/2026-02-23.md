# Daily Notes — 2026-02-23

## Session Summary

### Gemini API Key Rotation (3x today)
- Key was accidentally exposed in chat twice by Neo before the rule was hardened
- Final key installed securely via file attachment (no chat exposure)
- Both `auth.json` AND `auth-profiles.json` updated (lesson: must update both)
- `usageStats` cleared in auth-profiles.json to remove cooldown timers
- Inbound temp files deleted after each key install

### Gateway / Auth Fixes
- Zombie gateway process (pid 39982) killed — was blocking port 18789
- auth-profiles.json had old (revoked) Google key causing `FailoverError: No available auth profile for google (all in cooldown)`
- Gateway restarted clean after fixes

### Model Config Fixed
- Root cause of slow responses: `agents.defaults.model.primary` was `minimax/minimax-2.5` (should be `gemini-flash`)
- Fixed in openclaw.json: primary → `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`
- `ollama/qwen2.5:14b` removed from fallbacks — Ollama now heartbeats ONLY
- Security audit went from 1 critical → 0 critical

### PM2 Installed
- PM2 installed globally for dev server management
- `brand-value-canvas` (:3000) and `mission-control` (:3001) registered
- Paul ran `sudo ... pm2 startup launchd` — servers now auto-start on reboot
- `pm2 save` run to persist process list
- BOOT.md updated to reflect PM2 workflow

### File Structure Cleanup
- `briefing_gafford.md` and `WholeCEO-Briefing.md` moved from root → `memory/projects/book-promotion/planning/podcasts/`
- `memory/projects/brand-value-canvas-code.md` → `memory/projects/tech/`
- `memory/reference/memory-optimization.md` → `memory/archive/`
- `heartbeat-state.json` deleted (unused state tracker)
- `google-oauth.json` moved to `~/.openclaw/secrets/google-oauth.json` (chmod 600, outside workspace/git)
- `BOOT.md` updated for PM2

### Memory / Config Files Cleaned
- MEMORY.md: version, model routing, dev server lesson, stale decisions all updated
- SOUL.md: fallback model corrected
- IDENTITY.md: template boilerplate removed
- MEMORY.md: PM2 infrastructure entry added, API key rotation lessons added

### Mission Control Fix
- `projects` was in EXCLUDE list in `app/api/tree/route.ts` — removed it
- Now shows README/md files from projects/ and memory/projects/ in Docs view
- Hot reload applied, no restart needed

### Mission Control — Kanban Task Board (In Progress)
- `memory/tasks.json` created and seeded with 10 pending tasks from MEMORY.md
- First Claude Code attempt (session `tender-canyon`) stalled on bypass permissions prompt — killed
- Restarted with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` flag (session `neat-sable`) — running in background
- Files to be modified: `app/api/tasks/route.ts`, `app/tasks/page.tsx`, `app/team/page.tsx`
- DO NOT re-run Claude Code until neat-sable is confirmed done or failed

### Mission Control — Edit/Save for Docs
- Added `POST /api/files` endpoint — saves .md files only
- Updated `app/docs/page.tsx` with Edit (amber), Save (green), Cancel (grey) buttons
- File path shown in toolbar; monospace editor; "Saved" confirmation toast

### Calendar Alert (upcoming)
- Tue Feb 24 @ 5:30 PM — Sales POP! Podcast recording
- Barb and Jeff visiting Feb 25–Mar 4

- ✅ Gateway is healthy — do NOT restart unless there is a specific reason
- ✅ File moves are done — do NOT move files again

## Afternoon Session (3:00–4:00 PM)

### LinkedIn Import — COMPLETED
- All 17 posts added (lp-006 through lp-022) + 2 manually provided posts (lp-021, lp-022)
- Anchoring Bias draft (lp-023, postNumber 28) created by Kimi K2.5, published by Paul today
- **Total JSON: 28 posts (lp-001 to lp-023), all statuses correct**
- Next post ID: lp-024, next postNumber: 29
- Wednesday Feb 25 slot is open — no post scheduled yet

### Mission Control LinkedIn Page Improvements
- Post Archive now shows ALL statuses (not just published)
- Draft cards: wider, 4-line preview, explicit Edit + Posted + Copy buttons
- Copy button uses clipboard fallback (textarea + execCommand) for non-HTTPS local IP access

### WholeCEO Podcast — Critiqued (Feb 23, 2026)
- Episode: "AI, Algorithms, and Emotion, Oh My" with Lisa Goldenthal, ~20:43
- YouTube link: https://youtu.be/1G2l-qw385s?si=PLbVWkA7iQKmOQ6m
- Transcript extracted via `summarize --youtube auto --extract-only`
- **Key findings (standing delivery rules now in skills/podcast-prep-master.md):**
  - ~65 "uh/um" filler words in 20 min — biggest issue
  - Stumbled on own book title at the close (said it 3x before landing it)
  - "Hawkins razor" should be Occam's razor — correct this always
  - "Private parts" framing for reproductive driver is awkward — use "status/ego" instead
  - AI question was deflected instead of answered with a human advantage angle
  - No story-first structure in any answer — all concept, no scenes
  - BookLife Prize 10/10 and paullarche.com never mentioned
- Score: Framework 8/10, Storytelling 4/10, Delivery 5/10, AI answer 5/10, Book close 3/10

### Podcast Prep Skill — Rebuilt
- `skills/podcast-prep-master.md` completely rewritten from skeleton to full workflow
- 6-step process: show details → host research → talking points → delivery rules → briefing format → post-show critique
- Memory-efficient: no inline manuscript; uses memory_search() and QMD on demand
- Delivery rules baked in permanently from WholeCEO critique
- Pre-built AI answer included verbatim
- Standing story bank as QMD search pointers (no inline text)

### Voice Interaction Discussion
- Paul asked about whisper.cpp (Option B) for voice communication with Neo
- Answer: whisper.cpp would serve double duty — podcast transcription + Telegram voice note transcription
- For real-time voice (vs async), Telegram isn't ideal; Apple Shortcuts + Siri shortcut is closest
- Recommendation: install whisper.cpp for both use cases; no decision made yet (needs APPROVE)

### Sales POP! Podcast — Tomorrow
- Tue Feb 24 @ 5:30–6:30 PM via Restream (MUST use Google Chrome)
- Host: John Golden | Publicist: Jimmy Dwyer (Dalyn Miller PR)
- Prep briefing not yet run — offer to Paul before end of day or morning of

## Late Afternoon Session (4:00–4:22 PM)

- PDF saved: `memory/projects/book-promotion/podcasts/briefing-salespop-2026-02-24.pdf`
- Key angle: John is former CEO of Huthwaite (SPIN Selling) — audience is salespeople/sales leaders; frame all answers around "what does the salesperson do differently"
- 7 questions prepped with Scene openers; AI answer + book close verbatim included
- Delivered briefing summary to Paul via Telegram

### `memory/podcasts.json` Created
- New canonical JSON data store for all podcast shows

- Schema: id, showName, host, dates, platform, cheatSheet, anticipatedQuestions, postShow scores
- This is the source of truth for Mission Control Podcasts page

### Mission Control Podcasts Page — Sub-agent Timed Out
- Kimi K2.5 sub-agent spawned to build `app/podcasts/page.tsx` + `app/api/podcasts/route.ts` + nav update
- API route `app/api/podcasts/route.ts` was CREATED (confirmed)
- `app/podcasts/page.tsx` was NOT created before timeout
- Nav item NOT added to layout.tsx yet
- **TODO: Finish the podcasts page — either re-spawn or build manually**

### Podcast Prep Skill — Model Routing Added
- `skills/podcast-prep-master.md` updated with a full Model Routing table at the top
- Step 3 (Q&A/talking points): Gemini Flash does research, then delegates to Kimi K2.5 sub-agent
- Step 6 (post-show critique): Main agent extracts transcript, delegates analysis to Kimi K2.5
- PDF generation + orchestration stays with main agent (Gemini Flash)
- QMD re-indexed: 81 chunks embedded

**Re:** Keynote Proposal - "The Founder Trap: How Rapid Growth Destroys the Decision-Making That Built It"

Dear Inc. 5000 Programming Team,

Fast-growing companies do not fail because of market conditions. They fail because of decision fatigue.

Every founder in your audience has lived this pattern. The instincts that built the company to $5 million become liabilities at $50 million. The gut decisions that landed early customers create disasters in enterprise negotiations. The confidence that attracted initial investment morphs into the blind spots that alienate key hires.

The Inc. 5000 celebrates velocity. But velocity without behavioral awareness is a crash waiting to happen.

**The Divided Brain Framework**

My research in behavioral psychology reveals the neurological architecture behind this founder trap. The Old Brain (the ancient, emotional decision-maker) operates on pattern recognition, threat avoidance, and ego protection. It built the company through sheer force of will. The New Brain (the rational cortex) rationalizes those decisions and builds narratives of inevitability.

The problem: what got you here is encoded in neural pathways that become increasingly dangerous as scale increases.

Founders at the Inc. 5000 level face a specific crisis. Their Old Brain still thinks it is running a startup. Every hire feels like a bet-the-company decision. Every competitor move triggers survival responses. Every board meeting becomes a status battle rather than a strategic conversation. The New Brain constructs stories about vision and mission while the Old Brain drives reactive, fear-based choices.

This framework explains why scaling companies plateau, why founder-CEO transitions fail, and why the smartest entrepreneurs in the room make the dumbest strategic bets.

**Credentials**

*The Divided Brain: Behavioral Psychology for Better Decision Making* earned a perfect **10/10 score from the BookLife Prize** and was selected as an **Editor's Pick for 2025**. The book is also an **inaugural 2026 CANREADS Finalist**, recognizing Canadian nonfiction of exceptional merit.

I built and exited an advertising agency to Bell Media after 45 years in the industry. I have lived the founder journey, made the ego-driven mistakes, and developed the frameworks I wish I had owned decades earlier. My writing is conversational, authoritative, and free of em-dashes. Just practical psychology for leaders who need it.

**Proposed Session: "Scaling Without Crashing: Behavioral Psychology for High-Growth Founders"**

This keynote speaks directly to the Inc. 5000 audience: founders and CEOs who have proven product-market fit and now face the messier challenge of building organizations that do not depend on their daily heroics. Attendees will learn:

- Why the decision-making that built the company becomes a liability during scaling, and how to rebuild it consciously
- How to recognize when your Old Brain is driving reactive strategy rather than proactive growth
- The neurological reason founder burnout follows predictable patterns, and the reframe that prevents it
- Practical frameworks for delegating decisions without losing control, hiring executives who complement rather than clone your instincts, and building a culture that outlasts your presence

**Format:** 45-60 minute keynote with Q&A  
**Audience:** Inc. 5000 founders, CEOs, and executive teams navigating rapid growth

Your audience does not need another success story. They need a mirror that shows them why their own psychology is the next bottleneck to break through.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring this work to your Dallas stage and give Inc. 5000 leaders the behavioral frameworks their scaling companies demand.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

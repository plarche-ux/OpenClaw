**Re:** Keynote Proposal - "Why IT Leaders Lose the Room: The Neuroscience of Executive Influence"

Dear Gartner IT Symposium Programming Team,

IT leaders face a paradox that never makes it into the project charter. They command billion-dollar budgets. They oversee transformations that reshape entire industries. Yet they still lose the room in critical conversations with boards, CEOs, and business units.

The problem is not technical competence. It is neurological wiring.

**The Divided Brain Framework**

My work in behavioral psychology reveals a split that explains why brilliant IT strategy dies in presentation rooms. The Old Brain (the ancient, emotional decision-maker) evaluates every proposal through five filters before logic ever engages: Threat Detection, Return on Effort, Status Signaling, Contrast and Comparison, and Visual Override. The New Brain (the rational cortex) then builds the business case to justify what the Old Brain has already decided.

IT leaders typically speak to the New Brain. They lead with architecture diagrams, ROI calculations, and risk matrices. Meanwhile, the Old Brain of their audience has already categorized the message as threat, burden, or ego challenge. The decision is made before the slide deck advances.

This framework explains why digital transformations stall, why shadow IT proliferates, and why the best technical solutions lose to vendors who understand human decision-making.

**Credentials**

*The Divided Brain: Behavioral Psychology for Better Decision Making* earned a perfect **10/10 score from the BookLife Prize** and was selected as an **Editor's Pick for 2025**. The book is also an **inaugural 2026 CANREADS Finalist**, recognizing Canadian nonfiction of exceptional merit.

I bring 45 years of media and brand-building experience to this work, including building and exiting an advertising agency to Bell Media. My approach is practical, research-backed, and immediately applicable. No pop psychology. No em-dashes. Just frameworks that work.

**Proposed Session: "Leading the Old Brain: Why IT Strategy Fails and How to Fix It"**

This keynote addresses the specific pain your audience lives with daily: the gap between technical excellence and organizational buy-in. Attendees will learn:

- Why threat detection in the Old Brain sabotages cloud migration proposals before the technical review begins
- How to frame IT initiatives using the five Old Brain filters to secure faster approval and deeper commitment
- The neurological reason IT-business alignment breaks down, and the language patterns that rebuild it
- Practical tools for influencing executives who do not speak technology but control the budget

**Format:** 45-60 minute keynote with Q&A  
**Audience:** CIOs, CTOs, IT Directors, and senior technology leaders

I have delivered this material to executive audiences who recognize their own patterns in the framework. The response is consistent: "This explains conversations I have been failing at for years."

I would welcome the opportunity to bring this work to your Orlando stage and give IT leaders the behavioral tools their technical training never provided.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Art of Leadership Programming Team,

Leadership courses teach strategy. They teach communication. They teach change management. But they almost never teach the one subject that determines whether any of it works: how the human brain actually makes decisions.

Your audience knows the gap. They have read the frameworks. They have implemented the systems. They have given the speeches. And they have watched talented teams still resist, disengage, and make inexplicable choices that undermine everything the leadership playbook promised.

The art of leadership is not about better frameworks. It is about understanding the biological wiring of the people those frameworks are meant to influence.

**The Divided Brain Framework**

My work in behavioral psychology reveals a neurological split that changes everything about how leaders should approach their craft. The Old Brain (the ancient, emotional decision-maker) evaluates every situation through five filters: Threat Detection, Return on Effort, Status Signaling, Contrast and Comparison, and Visual Override. It decides in milliseconds. The New Brain (the rational cortex) then constructs the reasoning that justifies what the Old Brain has already chosen.

Leaders typically address the New Brain. They share logic, data, and strategic rationale. Meanwhile, the Old Brain of their team has already categorized the message as threat, burden, or status threat. Resistance forms before the town hall ends.

This framework explains why change initiatives fail, why high performers quit, why feedback conversations backfire, and why the best-laid strategies die in execution. It is not a people problem. It is a neuroscience problem.

**Credentials**

*The Divided Brain: Behavioral Psychology for Better Decision Making* earned a perfect **10/10 score from the BookLife Prize** and was selected as an **Editor's Pick for 2025**. The book is also an **inaugural 2026 CANREADS Finalist**, recognizing Canadian nonfiction of exceptional merit.

I bring 45 years of leadership experience, including building and exiting an advertising agency to Bell Media and earning a place in the Barrie Business Hall of Fame. My approach is grounded, practical, and free of the pop psychology that fills airport business books. No em-dashes. Just frameworks that align with how humans actually function.

**Proposed Session: "Leading the Old Brain: The Neuroscience of Influence and Alignment"**

This keynote addresses the core challenge of leadership: moving people from where they are to where they need to be, through influence rather than authority. Attendees will learn:

- Why threat detection in the Old Brain sabotages every change initiative, and how to frame transformation as opportunity rather than danger
- How status signaling drives organizational politics, and how leaders can work with it rather than pretend it does not exist
- The neurological reason feedback conversations fail, and the language patterns that bypass defensiveness
- Practical tools for building teams that align at the instinctive level, not just the intellectual one

**Format:** 45-60 minute keynote with Q&A  
**Audience:** Senior leaders, executives, and managers responsible for team performance and organizational culture

The Art of Leadership deserves a speaker who brings science to the art. Who shows leaders not just what to do, but why their people respond the way they do. Who bridges the gap between leadership theory and human reality.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring this work to your Toronto stage and give Canadian leaders the behavioral frameworks their teams need them to have.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

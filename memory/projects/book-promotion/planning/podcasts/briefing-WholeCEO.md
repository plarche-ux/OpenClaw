## 🧠 Core "Divided Brain" Talking Points for this Show

### 1. The CEO's "Automatic Transmission"
*   **Concept:** CEOs think they are making logical decisions (New Brain), but they are often just rationalizing gut impulses (Old Brain).
*   **The "Lisa G" Tie-in:** High performance isn't about ignoring the Old Brain; it's about shifting into "Manual Mode" (Metacognition) when the stakes are high.
*   **Key Quote:** "The Old Brain seizes, the New Brain explains."

### 2. Leading the "Elephant"
*   **Concept:** The Rider and the Elephant metaphor. A CEO can have the best strategy (The Rider), but if the team's "Old Brain" (The Elephant) doesn't feel safe or part of the tribe, the strategy fails.
*   **The "Human Upgrade" Angle:** Empathy is a competitive advantage, not a soft skill. It's the emotional bridge between the gears.

### 3. Decisions Under Pressure
*   **Concept:** Adrenaline and Cortisol (The Stress Duo) lock the Old Brain into gear.
*   **Practical Tip:** How to use a "5-second pause" to let the New Brain clutch in during a boardroom crisis.

## 📖 Recommended Book Snippet to Mention
*   **The Capuchin Monkey Experiment:** Perfect for discussing fairness in corporate culture and why hidden fees or broken promises kill brand loyalty (Old Brain "inequity aversion").

## Likely Questions + Opening Scene

**1. "What is the Old Brain / New Brain concept and why does it matter for sales?"**
→ *Scene:* "A client of mine once had two pitches in front of the same buyer. The first was flawless — data, ROI, case studies. Rejected in 20 minutes. The second was simpler, opened with a story, and closed the deal. Same product. Same price. I wrote the book to explain exactly why."
→ *Insight:* Old Brain decides on emotion, New Brain rationalizes after. In sales, most reps pitch to the wrong brain.

**2. "How does this change the way a salesperson should structure their pitch?"**
→ *Scene:* "In the 90s we ran a campaign for a mechanic named Ted. His wife Banita complained he was always too busy fixing customers' cars to fix hers. That tagline ran for 20 years. Three service bays became twenty. We never mentioned his prices."
→ *Insight:* Lead with emotion — a problem, a story, a shared frustration. Facts come second, as justification, not persuasion.

**3. "AI is writing sales emails, scoring leads, automating outreach — where does the human advantage live?"**
→ *Answer (use verbatim):* "The human advantage is authentic emotional connection. AI can optimize for conversion, but it can't sit across the table and make someone feel genuinely understood. That's still a human skill. The sales reps who win in an AI world use AI for efficiency and reserve their human energy for trust-building."

**4. "What's the biggest mistake salespeople make when it comes to emotional intelligence?"**
→ *Scene:* "They think EI means being warm and likeable. It doesn't. The Old Brain's primary job is to detect threat. If your buyer feels any friction — a confusing proposal, a pushy tone, a hidden fee — the Old Brain flags you as a threat and the deal is dead before your New Brain pitch even lands."
→ *Insight:* EI in sales means removing threat signals first, then building trust.

**5. "How does loss aversion factor into the sales process?"**
→ *Insight:* Losses are felt 2x more intensely than equivalent gains. Stop selling what the buyer will gain. Show what they are currently losing by NOT acting.
→ *Example:* "Instead of 'our CRM will boost efficiency 20%,' say 'you're losing 20% of your team's selling time to manual data entry every week.' Same fact. One activates the Old Brain."

**6. "What about buyer resistance and objection handling?"**
→ *Insight:* Most objections are Old Brain threat responses, not logical counterarguments. Arguing with logic deepens resistance. Acknowledge the feeling first ("That's a fair concern..."), then provide the rational anchor the New Brain needs to justify moving forward.

**7. "Where can people find the book and learn more?"**
→ *Use exactly:* **"It's called The Divided Brain — available on Amazon and at paullarche.com."**

## Sales-Specific Angles (John's Audience)
John's listeners are in sales. Frame everything through the sales lens:
- Old Brain = the real decision-maker in every B2B and B2C interaction
- Most salespeople are trained to sell to the New Brain (features, ROI, logic) — that's why they lose
- The rep who understands Old Brain triggers will outsell the one with the better product
- SPIN Selling angle if he brings it: *"SPIN works because Situation and Problem questions surface the buyer's own pain — you're letting the Old Brain identify its own threat. That's genius."*

## MOCHA — Your Framework (Use If It Comes Up)

**MOCHA** is a customer experience flywheel Paul developed during his radio career. It's a natural bridge between sales methodology and behavioral psychology — and a credibility signal that you've been doing this long before the book.

**The loop:** Make → Our → Customers → Happy → Always → (back to Make)

| Letter | Stage | Core idea |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **M** | Make | Internal foundation — right people, right strategy, will to win |
| **O** | Our | Define who your customers actually are (clients, advocates, employees) |
| **C** | Customers | See the world through their eyes — demo, psycho, generational |
| **H** | Happy | *Emotion is the key.* This is the whole game. |
| **A** | Always | Best practices + training + NPS — until you find a better way |

**The Divided Brain connection:**
> "MOCHA's H is where I landed before I understood the neuroscience. Emotion is the key — we knew that from 30 years of radio. The Divided Brain just gave me the explanation for *why*. The Old Brain decides. The New Brain writes the justification memo after."

**If John brings up SPIN Selling:**
> "SPIN and MOCHA are actually complementary. SPIN is brilliant because Situation and Problem questions let the buyer's Old Brain identify its own threat — you're not pushing, you're revealing. MOCHA says once you've done that, the H has to be real. You can surface the pain perfectly and still lose the deal if the emotional experience of working with you doesn't feel right."

**If he asks about your background building it:**
> "I built five radio stations from scratch. In radio, you live or die on listener loyalty — you can't force someone to stay tuned. MOCHA came out of figuring out why some stations created fans who'd call in at 2am, and others just had audiences. The difference was always emotional. The Divided Brain is the science underneath what we were doing intuitively."

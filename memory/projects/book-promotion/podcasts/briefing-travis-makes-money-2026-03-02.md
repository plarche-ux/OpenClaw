## Likely Questions + Your Opening Scene

### 1. How can understanding the brain help entrepreneurs actually make more money?
**Scene:** Picture a customer staring at your sales page. Their finger hovers over the buy button. In that split second, they are not calculating ROI or comparing features. They are feeling something. And that feeling will either push them to buy or click away.
**Key point:** The Old Brain makes the decision in milliseconds based on emotion and pattern recognition. The New Brain shows up afterward to justify the purchase with logic. Entrepreneurs who speak to the Old Brain first close more sales.
**Book tie:** Chapter 3 of *The Divided Brain* breaks down exactly how to identify and trigger the emotional patterns that drive purchasing decisions.

### 2. Why do customers sometimes reject great offers that make perfect logical sense?
**Scene:** In 2009, Tropicana spent $35 million on a sleek new package design. The juice was identical. The price was the same. But sales cratered by 20% and they lost $65 million in weeks. Customers were not rejecting the product. They were rejecting a violation of what their Old Brain recognized as familiar and safe.
**Key point:** The Old Brain craves pattern recognition and familiarity. Change the packaging, the process, or the presentation too drastically and it triggers threat response, even when the New Brain agrees the change is better.
**Book tie:** The Tropicana case study appears in Chapter 7, which explores how breaking familiar patterns can destroy trust even with superior products.

### 3. What is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make when trying to persuade customers?
**Scene:** Two researchers set up a jam tasting booth. One table offered 24 flavors. The other offered just 6. The big table attracted more visitors. But the small table generated ten times more sales. More options felt like freedom to the New Brain but felt like paralysis to the Old Brain.
**Key point:** The Old Brain shuts down when overwhelmed by choice. It wants clarity, not options. Entrepreneurs who simplify their offers remove the friction that kills conversions.
**Book tie:** The jam study and the psychology of choice overload are covered in Chapter 5.

### 4. How do you build trust with customers in a world where everyone is skeptical?
**Scene:** We worked with a local mechanic named Ted who wanted his first radio campaign to be all about his equipment and pricing. Instead, we ran an ad featuring his wife, Banita, complaining that Ted was always too busy helping customers to fix her car. The campaign ended with the line, "We fix anyone's car, except Banita's!"
**Key point:** Radical transparency and character-driven stories disarm the Old Brain's threat detection. When you lead with values instead of technical specs, the Old Brain stops scanning for danger and starts feeling safe enough to trust you.
**Book tie:** The story of Ted and Banita appears in the Introduction of *The Divided Brain* as the spark that led to the book's core insights.

### 5. What does behavioral psychology teach us about pricing and fairness?
**Scene:** Two capuchin monkeys perform the same task. One gets a grape. The other gets a cucumber. The cucumber monkey loses its mind. It rejects the food completely. It would rather have nothing than accept something it perceives as unfair, even when hungry.
**Key point:** Fairness is not a moral concept to the Old Brain. It is a survival mechanism. Customers will walk away from profitable deals if the terms feel exploitative because their Old Brain flags unfairness as a threat.
**Book tie:** The capuchin monkey experiment opens Chapter 4, which reframes fairness as a biological imperative that shapes all economic behavior.

### 6. How can entrepreneurs train themselves to make better decisions under pressure?
**Scene:** Your ancestor hears rustling in the bush. In a millisecond, the body floods with chemicals. Heart rate spikes. Vision narrows. The Old Brain has already decided to run before the New Brain even registers what caused the sound. That instinct saved lives ten thousand years ago. Today it causes panic selling, rash hires, and burned bridges in negotiation.
**Key point:** The lion in the bush response still fires for modern threats like email bombs or critical feedback. Entrepreneurs who recognize when their Old Brain has hijacked the wheel can pause and let the New Brain reassert control.
**Book tie:** Chapter 10 provides specific techniques for identifying and interrupting Old Brain hijack in high-stakes business moments.

## AI Question (use verbatim)
"The human advantage is authentic emotional connection. AI can optimize for conversion, but it can't sit across the table from someone and make them feel genuinely understood. That's still a human skill. The brands that win in an AI world use AI for efficiency and reserve their human energy for trust-building."

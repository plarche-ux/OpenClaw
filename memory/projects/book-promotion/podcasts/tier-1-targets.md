# Tier 1 Podcast Targets for Paul Larche

**Audience Focus:** CEOs, High-Growth Founders, Senior Executive Leaders
**Themes:** Behavioral Psychology, Leadership, Strategy, Decision-Making

## 1. Masters of Scale
*   **Host:** Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn Co-founder) and guest hosts like Jordan Harbinger.
*   **Host Details:** Reid Hoffman is one of the most successful entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley history. The show features "iconic business leaders" (e.g., CEOs of Airbnb, Netflix, Nike).
*   **Why It's a Tier 1 Fit:** This is the gold standard for high-growth founders and Inc. 5000-level leaders. The show's entire premise is about the *strategy* of scaling. Paul’s "Divided Brain" framework provides a psychological lens on the leadership decisions required to scale, offering a unique "inner game" perspective to their "outer game" narratives.

## 2. The Knowledge Project
*   **Host:** Shane Parrish.
*   **Host Details:** Founder of Farnam Street, a platform dedicated to mastering the best of what other people have already figured out. He is highly respected by the elite business community for his deep dives into mental models.
*   **Why It's a Tier 1 Fit:** The audience consists of decision-makers, hedge fund managers, and CEOs who are obsessed with improving their mental models and decision-making frameworks. Paul’s behavioral psychology expertise (Old Brain vs. New Brain) is a direct match for the show’s focus on the psychological tendencies that drive success and failure.

## 3. HBR IdeaCast
*   **Host:** Sarah Green Carmichael and other Harvard Business Review editors.
*   **Host Details:** The podcast arm of the world's most prestigious management journal, HBR.
*   **Why It's a Tier 1 Fit:** This is a "must-listen" for Gartner attendees and senior corporate executives. It is strictly strategy and leadership-focused. Paul’s credentials (BookLife Prize 10/10) and his executive-level focus on behavioral psychology for decision-making align perfectly with HBR’s authoritative, science-backed approach to management.

## 4. CEO Coaching International Podcast
*   **Hosts:** Mark Moses and Steve Sanduski.
*   **Host Details:** Mark Moses is the founder of CEO Coaching International, which coaches hundreds of the world’s most successful CEOs and entrepreneurs.
*   **Why It's a Tier 1 Fit:** This show is hyper-targeted at the CEO/Founder level. It focuses on the specific challenges of scaling a business ("Make BIG Happen"). Paul’s framework for "Better Decision Making" addresses the core psychological hurdles these CEOs face when moving from tactical execution to strategic leadership.

## 5. Gartner ThinkCast
*   **Host:** Alexis Wierenga (and various Gartner analysts).
*   **Host Details:** The official podcast of Gartner, the world's leading research and advisory company.
*   **Why It's a Tier 1 Fit:** This is the most direct link to the Gartner audience. It features conversations with top experts on news-making business and IT trends. Bringing a behavioral psychology perspective to current strategic challenges (like AI adoption or organizational change) would position Paul as a thought leader in the exact circle he wants to influence.

**Recommended Action for Neo/Trinity:** Trinity should draft a high-level pitch for Paul focusing on the "Old Brain vs. New Brain" framework as a tool for "Strategic Decision-Making under Pressure," specifically tailored for each host's typical interview style (e.g., "Mental Models" for Shane Parrish, "Scaling Hurdles" for Reid Hoffman).

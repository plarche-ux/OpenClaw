# What Barrie Cares is About

Barrie Cares is a community-led coalition and non-profit organization that unites public, private, and non-profit sectors to address the complex issue of homelessness in Barrie. Acting as the lead agency under the City of Barrie’s Community Safety & Well-Being Plan, the organization serves as a catalyst for collaboration, a relationship broker, and a fundraiser, rather than a direct service provider.

Their vision is to make homelessness a solvable challenge by building a coordinated, compassionate system where no one falls through the cracks. The core strategy of Barrie Cares is the development of a two-phase "Campus of Care" (CoC)—a centralized physical intake and assessment facility that brings health, wellness, housing navigation, and social supports under one roof to move people from crisis to stability.

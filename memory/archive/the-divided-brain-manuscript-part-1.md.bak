**"People don't think how they feel, they don't say what they think,
and they don't do what they say."**

David Ogilvy, often called "The Father of Advertising"

# **Chapter 1: Introduction**

Why do intelligent, capable people sometimes act in ways that make us
scratch our heads?

Why does your coworker keep showing up late, even after being spoken to
about it? Why does your friend buy yet another "miracle" supplement from
Instagram while ignoring their doctor's advice? Why do some people pour
money into get-rich-quick schemes while disregarding sound financial
guidance? Or why do we cling emotionally to things we no longer need but
just can't let go of?

We've all seen behaviour that feels irrational, and if you work in
business, branding, or leadership, you see it daily. Understanding why
people behave the way they do isn't just fascinating, it's essential.

I've spent most of my life asking those kinds of questions. Not as a
psychologist, but as a marketer, first in radio broadcasting and
advertising, then as the founder of my own stations and agency.

My career accelerated in the '90s when I became General Manager of
**Telemedia Network Radio** in Toronto. At the time, we produced the
live radio broadcasts for the **Toronto Blue Jays** and **Toronto Maple
Leafs**. That role gave me a front-row seat to work with North America's
top ad agencies, representing some of the world's biggest brands.

That's where I had my first big realization: the ads that *worked*, that
truly moved people to act, weren't about facts. It wasn't the horsepower
that sold the car; it was how it made you feel behind the wheel. It
wasn't the memory capacity that sold the computer; it was what you could
*do* with it. And nobody ever chose a beer brand for the hops, it was
about identity, belonging, and story. The emotional message almost
always won.

At the time, I didn't know the science behind it. I just knew it worked.
As I built my business and helped others build theirs, I became
determined to dig deeper. If I could crack the code, not just the *how*,
but the *why*, I knew we could give our clients a serious edge.

That curiosity evolved into a lifelong quest. I devoured books, took
courses, and tested new ideas in the real world. Through years of trial,
error, and more than a few wrong turns, I came to a clear conclusion:

**Understanding human behaviour is essential in business.**

Whether you're trying to sell, lead, negotiate, or inspire, the better
you understand how people think and feel, the more effective you'll be.

As a new radio station owner in Barrie, Ontario, I was eager to put
these insights to use. I remember working with Ted, a local mechanic who
had just launched his own shop. For his first radio campaign, we didn't
talk about his equipment or pricing. Instead, we focused on his
personality. The ad featured a conversation with his wife, Banita, who
needed her car fixed, but Ted was always too busy helping customers
because their needs came first.

That was the *message.*

It wasn't about service bays or diagnostic tools. It was about values
and character. The ad worked. Ted's business grew from three bays to
twenty over the years, and the commercials ran for two decades, always
ending with the same line:

**"We fix anyone's car, except Banita's!"**

As our company expanded across the province with additional stations and
a marketing agency, I found myself giving countless presentations on
branding and behaviour, training our teams, advising clients, and
speaking at industry conferences. After nearly every talk, someone would
come up to me and say, "That makes so much sense. Can you explain more?"
This book is my way of saying yes.

What you will discover here isn't academic theory; it's practical,
real-world behavioural science rooted in areas such as:

**- Evolutionary psychology** explains how our brains are still wired
for survival, driving instincts to form tribes, seek safety, and chase
rewards.

**- Behavioural economics** shows that people rarely decide based on
logic alone. We're influenced by biases, emotion, and mental
shortcuts.

**- Neuroscience,** which reveals what's happening inside the brain as
we think, feel, and choose.

These fields provided the *why*. But when it came to teaching clients, I
needed a clearer, more actionable model. They didn't want jargon, they
wanted tools.

That's why I developed the **Divided Brain** metaphor.

It's a simple yet powerful framework, or "hack," that helps us
understand how people think and why they act the way they do.

**What's Ahead**

In the chapters ahead, I'll introduce the core framework of *The Divided
Brain*, built on a powerful metaphor: our minds operate like two
interlocking gears, the fast, emotional Old Brain and the slower,
logical New Brain. These systems shape how we think, feel, and act every
day, often without us realizing it.

**- Chapters 1--4** lay the foundation, helping you understand how
these two mental gears work, and how they drive real-world behaviour.

**- Chapters 5--6** explore the pitfalls of modern thinking: how our
fast-paced, complex world magnifies cognitive errors, and how learning
to spot them can lead to better outcomes.

**- Chapters 7--8** focus on the role of emotion in communication and
branding, and how to use it to connect more deeply and persuasively.

**- Chapters 9--11** introduce techniques like familiarity,
storytelling, and archetypes, tools that help your brand stick

**- Chapters 12--13** shift from insight to action, offering practical
tools, including how to ethically "nudge" behaviour and apply the
Brand Value Canvas to your own work.

Whether you're building a business, leading a team, or simply curious
about what makes people tick, this book will show you how to communicate
more effectively, lead with empathy, and build brands that truly
resonate.

If you're ready to decode what drives human decisions, and use that
knowledge to level up your brand, your business, and your relationships,
let's begin.

# **Chapter 2: The Divided Brain**

**"In evolutionary terms, each of us is a committee of brains layered
one upon another, still striving to act as one."**

Paul D. MacLean, neuroscientist

Early in my career, I kept running into the same paradox: the marketing
campaigns that actually moved the needle always led with emotion, yet
most clients insisted on leading with facts. Bullet points. Technical
specs. Rational arguments.

Whenever I told them that emotion opens the wallet and logic only
justifies the purchase, the room would go quiet. Eyes glazed. Pens
paused. I needed a better way to explain what I had come to know
intuitively, that an offer can look flawless on a spreadsheet and still
flop at the cash register.

The real challenge was teaching the science of human behaviour,
something complex, nuanced, and deeply rooted in psychology, in a way
that was fast, intuitive, and sticky. Something they could *use*, not
just understand.

That's what led me to create the **Divided Brain metaphor**.

It all clicked when I sketched it out: two interlocking gears, one
driven by emotion, the other by logic. As I walked clients through how
these gears turn in tandem to shape decisions, something shifted. Heads
nodded. The fog lifted. It gave them a clear, practical lens for
decoding customer behaviour, and building brands that actually persuade.

## A Word of Clarity: This Isn\'t Brain Surgery (Literally!)

Before we dive deeper, let\'s be clear: the \"Divided Brain\" is a
powerful metaphor, not a neuroscientist\'s anatomical chart. Our
actual brains are marvels of complexity, and the frontiers of
neuroscience are still expanding. Think of my model like the familiar
\"left brain/right brain\" shorthand we use for logic versus creativity,
useful for discussion, even if the science is more nuanced.

So, why this metaphor? Because its strength lies not in pinpoint
biological accuracy, but in its *practical power*. It\'s designed to
help you, the reader, cut through the noise of human decision making and
ask smarter questions: How can I tap into gut feelings without being
manipulative? How do I build genuine trust by appealing to both heart
and head?

By embracing the simplicity of the Old and New Brain gears, you don\'t
need a PhD in neuroscience to unlock potent behavioural insights.
Whether you\'re crafting a brand that resonates, leading a team more
effectively, or simply becoming more aware of your own decision-making,
this model is your practical toolkit. Our aim isn\'t to dissect the
brain\'s every intricacy, but to equip you to harness its observable
patterns for real-world success.

## Imagine Your Mind as a Set of Two Interlocked Gears

The Divided Brain metaphor shows the larger Old Brain connected to the
smaller New Brain.

**The larger gear, your Old Brain, sits anatomically in the brain's
posterior regions, toward the back and middle of your head.** It
includes all the parts you may remember from high school biology: the
brainstem, limbic system, amygdala, hippocampus, and most everything
*except* the neocortex. These evolutionarily ancient structures are
responsible for instinct, emotion, and survival. We'll explore their
specific traits in Chapters 3 and 4.

**The smaller gear, tucked just behind your forehead, is what we'll call
the New Brain.** It refers to the neocortex, and more specifically, the
prefrontal cortex, which plays a starring role in conscious reasoning.
For simplicity, I'll use "neocortex" throughout the book, even though
many of the studies I cite focus on its prefrontal region. They're
functionally interchangeable for our metaphor.

By the way, **the prefix "neo-" comes from the Greek néos, meaning
new.** This part of the brain is especially developed in humans and
enables our most advanced abilities: language, planning,
self-reflection, and long-term decision-making. We'll dive deeper into
its characteristics in Chapter 5.

**Together, these two gears drive every thought, choice, and behaviour
you make.** Most of the time, they turn in sync. But when they fall out
of alignment, when instinct overrides logic, or emotion drowns out
reason, behaviour gets hijacked. That breakdown is what we'll examine in
Chapters 6 and 7.

We'll explore both systems in depth soon. But for now, remember this:

**You're not running on one brain. You're running on two, and they don't
always agree.**

I'm not asking you to take this model on faith alone. In the following
pages, I'll connect the Divided Brain metaphor to **well-established
theories** in neuroscience and psychology, showing how it reflects the
best of what we know about human behaviour, and how you can use it to
make better decisions, build stronger brands, and connect more deeply
with others.

## Exploring Brain Models

## 1. The Triune Brain Model

In the 1960s, neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean proposed the Triune Brain
Model to describe the evolutionary development of the vertebrate brain
and its associated behaviours. He divided the brain into three
categories1^:

**1. Reptilian Brain (Brain Stem):** The oldest part, dating back
nearly 500 million years, controls basic survival functions like
breathing and heartbeat. It operates on autopilot, ensuring we stay
alive without conscious thought.

**2. Limbic System:** Developed roughly 100 million years ago, this is
the brain's emotional centre. It governs feelings, memories, and
instincts like fear and pleasure. Ever felt a rush of joy or a pang of
anxiety? That's your limbic system in action.

**3. Neocortex:** The newest addition, particularly the larger frontal
lobe, sets us apart from other species. This is where higher-order
thinking occurs, such as language, reasoning, and problem-solving.

Although neuroscience has revealed far more complexity and
interconnection than MacLean's model initially suggested, its core
principles still help us grasp the layered nature of our brain's
evolution.

The Divided Brain merges the Reptilian Brain and the Limbic System into
what is known as the Old Brain, while the Neocortex represents the New
Brain.

## 2. Thinking Fast and Slow: System 1 and System 2

Daniel Kahneman, in his influential book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*
(2011), describes two distinct systems2^ of human thought:

**System 1 (Fast):**

- This is your **autopilot.** It runs everything subconsciously to
keep you alive.

- It's effortless, unconscious, and incredibly fast.

- Doesn\'t rely on logic.

- Driven by basic instincts: eat, survive, feel safe, feel good,
reproduce.

*[Example:]* Ever slam on the brakes when a car cuts you
off? You didn't sit and reason it out, you just reacted. That's System 1
at work.

**System 2 (Slow):**

- This kicks in when you need to concentrate and solve complex
problems.

- It's deliberate, logical, energy-consuming, and much slower at
processing information.

- Helps you make reasoned decisions and think before you act.

- It's language-based, not feeling-based

*[Example:]* Deciding on a mortgage plan requires System 2.
You weigh options, compare rates, and think about long-term
implications.

Recognizing that System 1 drives most of our daily decisions can
revolutionize how you approach branding. If you can tap into that
fast-thinking system, your message will resonate better.

The Old Brain resembles System 1 in the divided brain metaphor, while
the New Brain borrows from System 2.

## 3. The Rider and the Elephant Metaphor

In his influential book *The Happiness Hypothesis* (2006), psychologist
Jonathan Haidt offers a powerful metaphor to illustrate the divided
mind: the rider and the elephant.3^

**1. The Elephant:** Represents our emotions, intuition, and automatic
processes. It's big and powerful and moves based on instinct.

**2. The Rider:** Represents conscious, controlled thought. The rider
can plan and guide, but ultimately depends on the elephant's
cooperation.

The rider may hold the reins, but if the elephant wants to go in a
different direction, there\'s little the rider can do. While we think
we\'re in control (the rider), our emotions and instincts (the elephant)
often dictate our actions.

In our metaphor, the Old Brain represents the elephant, while the New
Brain symbolizes the rider.

**Three Models, One Truth**

Before we begin applying the Divided Brain to real-world situations,
let's take a moment to build a clearer foundation for the metaphor
itself. The models we've just explored ---Triune Brain, System 1 and 2,
and the Rider and Elephant---highlight a universal truth: human
behaviour is driven by **two distinct systems**, one fast and emotional,
the other slow and deliberate. The Divided Brain metaphor simplifies
this idea into something visual, memorable, and practical: two
interlocking gears working together to drive thought and action.

In the following sections, I'll provide more evolutionary and biological
context and explain how this gear-based metaphor captures the rhythm,
tension, and interaction between our instinctive Old Brain and our
reflective New Brain.

## The Brain\'s Evolutionary Journey

To fully grasp why the Old Brain frequently dominates the New Brain, we
must examine the evolutionary history of our brain's development. This
process stretches back hundreds of millions of years, with each phase
contributing new layers of complexity and capability.

**Evolution Timeline Image (next page):** *The Old Brain evolved from
early vertebrates 475 million years ago. Mammals added emotional depth
with the limbic system around 120 million years ago. The neocortex
emerged about 2 million years ago, significantly developing in Homo
sapiens in the last three hundred thousand years.*

Let's delve into more features and traits of our metaphor.

## Our Superpower: Lots of Neurons

How did Homo sapiens evolve from roaming the Serengeti to walking on the
moon? How did we learn to channel our animal instincts into building
societies, creating language, and inventing the modern conveniences we
enjoy today? The key factor is our neuron-rich brain, or more
appropriately, brains!

Neurons are specialized cells that drive our thoughts, emotions, and
actions. Consider them tiny messengers in your brain, each capable of
sending and receiving electrical and chemical signals. Every neuron has
about a thousand synaptic branches (see illustration) that connect with
other synapses. When you feel excitement over a new gadget, contemplate
a business plan, or decide what to have for dinner, neurons fire away,
sharing information across complex networks. We'll explore how the
electrical and chemical systems communicate between neurons when we
discuss neurotransmitters and hormones in Chapter 8.

Humans possess about **86 billion neurons**!

These billions of neurons form roughly **100 trillion (15 zeros)
synaptic connections** among them. To put that number in perspective,
your brain has more neural connections **than stars in our galaxy**. Our
closest relatives, chimpanzees, have around 28 billion neurons. This
difference provides humans with an extraordinary capacity for abstract
thinking, complex language, and the ability to rally around significant
ideas. Our neuronal advantage lays the groundwork for everything from
art and music to corporate cultures and entire civilizations.

## Fast and Slow

The lopsidedness of the neuron count between the Old and New Brain lays
bare the sheer processing power of each gear. This likely influenced
Daniel Kahneman's title choice for his aforementioned book *Thinking,
Fast and Slow* (2011).

**Very Fast**

The Old Brain, with nearly four and a half times more neurons than the
New Brain, enables it to process information extremely quickly (**11
million bits per second**4^) and [simultaneously] with all
of our sensory inputs.

**Very Slow**

In contrast, the New Brain, with less than 20% of the total neuron
count, is significantly slower at processing information (**50 bits per
second**) and can only focus on **one task at a time**.

The New Brain is a recent evolutionary development that can be likened
to new software that still has inherent bugs, especially when contrasted
with the long-established and reliable Old Brain software.

## Remember This

Memory isn't stored in one place, it's divided, just like the brain
itself. And the split between the **Old Brain** and **New Brain**
reveals a lot about how we process, store, and recall information.

Your New Brain is where **short-term memory** lives. Think of it as your
mental desktop. It's where you hold a phone number just long enough to
dial it, or juggle the points you want to make in a meeting. It's
active, conscious, and fleeting, handling just a few pieces of
information at a time.5^

The **Old Brain**, by contrast, is the brain's **deep storage
archive,**6^ especially when emotion is involved. That's why you
vividly remember the smell of your grandmother's house or exactly where
you were when you heard life-changing news. The Old Brain tags those
memories with emotional weight and files them away, sometimes for
life.7^

This matters because it explains why emotion beats logic in so many
decisions: **the Old Brain isn't just reacting, it's remembering**. When
you get a strong gut feeling, it may be pulling from dozens of past
experiences your conscious mind can't fully access. Meanwhile, your New
Brain is left trying to reason with a limited window of recent
information.

Never underestimate which brain is holding the receipts in branding,
leadership, or daily decision-making. The memories that shape your
judgement, and your customers', **are stored in the Old Brain**. If you
want to create lasting impressions, you must speak the language of
emotion, because that's what the long-term memory gear is listening for.

## The Old Brain Seizes, the New Brain Explains

At our radio stations, we trained dozens of sales reps, not just to
close deals, but to help advertisers get real results. I always opened
those sessions with the same line: *"People buy on emotion and justify
with fact."* Our team understood this well because they grasped the
Old/New Brain dynamic.

As we'll explore more deeply in the following two chapters, decisions
begin in the **Old Brain**---fast, emotional, and subconscious. The
**New Brain** doesn't initiate the action; it arrives later to
rationalize it. Chapter 5 will cover much more.

A classic example? **The impulse buy:** the Old Brain shouts *"Yes!"*
before the New Brain even weighs in. Then, just seconds later, the
justifications start rolling in---*"I need this for work,"* or *"It's a
good investment."* That's your New Brain crafting a logical narrative to
defend an emotionally driven choice, preserving your self-image as
rational and thoughtful.

## Shifting Gears: Automatic vs. Manual Thinking

The Divided Brain is part of an **automatic transmission** system. Most
of the time, the Old Brain is in charge, making fast, instinctive
decisions without bothering the New Brain. When needed, like when a
situation becomes unfamiliar, risky, or complex, the system briefly
shifts gears, calling on the New Brain for support. But just like cruise
control, it snaps back to autopilot as soon as possible.

But what if you *want* to remain in rational, reflective mode? Then you
have to take over the controls, switching from automatic to manual. This
is called metacognition, which we will cover in Chapter 5.

And just like driving a car with a manual transmission, this **takes
effort.** You need to lift your foot off the gas consciously, press in
the mental clutch, and guide yourself into the right gear. It doesn't
happen passively. You have to slow down, stay present, and engage with
intention.

**Learning when to stay in automatic and when to shift into manual is
one of the most valuable mental skills you can develop---for life,
leadership, and branding.**

## Applying The Divided Brain

The chapters ahead will show you how to use the Divided Brain metaphor
not just as a branding tool, but as a lens for understanding human
behaviour---your own, your clients', your colleagues', and even the
little humans you may be raising.

Once you grasp this concept, irrational behaviour begins to look more
predictable. You start to read between the lines and cut through the
daily noise. Seeing the brain as two interlocking gears helps you decode
actions that once felt confusing. A client's sudden reversal or a
child's emotional outburst isn't random, it's often the Old Brain
spinning into action while the New Brain lags behind.

With this insight, you can guide conversations more effectively, manage
relationships more smoothly, and steer outcomes more intentionally. The
Divided Brain gives you a practical model for navigating complexity, not
by overpowering emotion with logic, but by **shifting gears** between
them.

By the end of this book, you'll know how to engage both brains in the
right sequence. You'll speak first to the Old Brain, connecting
emotionally through instinct, emotion, and desire, then shift into New
Brain mode, reinforcing that spark with rational clarity and structure.
That gear shift isn't just persuasive, it's sustainable. It helps people
feel something and understand why.

Here's a handy cheat sheet table on what we've covered. Some terms are
covered in later in the book:

## Wrapping It Up

Understanding the dynamic between the Old Brain and the New Brain isn't
just neuroscience, it's a practical key to human behaviour. Across
models like the Triune Brain, dual-system thinking, and the
rider-and-elephant analogy, one truth stands out: **emotion drives,
logic supports**.

In the chapters ahead, we'll turn this insight into action. You'll learn
how to craft strategies and build brands that resonate emotionally *and*
make sense rationally, helping people not just remember what you said,
but feel it.

That's the sweet spot where influence lives: emotional instinct paired
with logical clarity, working together in sync.

**Chapter 3: The Old Brain**

**"The very essence of instinct is that it's followed independently of
reason."**

Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (1871)

A few years ago, I woke up at 5 a.m. to photograph the sunrise at
Moraine Lake in Alberta, an ideal location for any landscape
photographer, a passion of mine then. As I trekked in the faint light,
with my camera gear secured on my back, I suddenly heard a soft rustling
and a deep snort just off the trail. In an instant, my body tightened,
and my heart raced. Without hesitation, I froze and scanned the trees,
certain I was about to encounter what had been reported in the area the
previous day: a grizzly bear. Fortunately, it turned out to be just a
deer moving through the underbrush, but my reaction was purely rooted in
fear and instinct, there was no room for logic or careful consideration.

That's the Old Brain doing what it does best: keeping us alive by
reacting first and asking questions later. In that split second,
survival trumped everything else. The same Old Brain instincts are
constantly at play in branding and marketing. People don't always slowly
reason through a choice; sometimes, they just *feel* something is safe,
exciting, or worth avoiding. That first emotional flash often steers
their decisions before the New Brain even has a chance to weigh in.

## Characteristics of the Larger Gear

Ever find yourself tossing a familiar brand into your cart without
comparing prices? Or ordering your usual at a restaurant, even when you
told yourself you'd try something new? Maybe you've stuck with the same
phone plan for years, not because it's the best deal, but because
switching feels like a hassle. That's your Old Brain at work in
automatic transmission mode---the big, bossy gear behind the curtain,
making fast, comfortable choices while your New Brain is still busy
tying its shoes. Let's pull back that curtain and see how this ancient
mental machinery shapes everyday decisions, quietly calling the shots
before you even realize you've made a choice.

**Let's spotlight the essential traits of the Old Brain that we're all
born with:**

**- Survival-Driven:** The Old Brain's primary purpose is to protect
us. For example, when you instinctively slam on the brakes at the
sight of brake lights ahead, that's your Old Brain reacting instantly
to perceived danger, just as it did for our ancestors spotting threats
in the wild.

**- Automatic and Fast:** This system runs beneath our awareness,
processing massive amounts of information every second. You might not
realize you noticed a car drifting toward your lane until you've
already started to move away, evidence of the Old Brain's rapid,
automatic action.

**- Emotional and Intuitive:** The Old Brain acts on gut feelings and
emotions. Think of the unease you feel in a dark alley or the
immediate comfort you sense around a close friend. These reactions are
not rational calculations, but instinctive, emotional responses rooted
in this part of the brain.

**- Energy-Efficient:** To conserve energy, the Old Brain favours
habits and shortcuts. For instance, you instinctively check your phone
the moment you wake up, even if you told yourself you'd start the day
differently. It's familiar, effortless, and doesn't require burning
additional calories.

**- Prefers Routine:** The Old Brain finds comfort in predictability.
This is why you gravitate toward the same seat in meetings or on your
daily commute. When that pattern is disrupted, it can feel more
jarring than it logically should, because your Old Brain is quietly
craving familiarity.

**- Pattern Recognition:** The Old Brain quickly spots patterns, often
without conscious awareness. For example, it helps you recognize a
familiar face in a crowd or detect the warning signs of an approaching
storm, skills that were crucial for survival and still guide our
decisions today.

**- Stores Long-Term Memory:** Emotional and experiential memories are
stored in the Old Brain. This is why a familiar smell can trigger a
vivid memory or why emotionally charged experiences are more deeply
etched into our minds.

In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at these built-in traits.
This is the essence of the Divided Brain model: recognizing that much of
our behaviour is shaped by **automatic, unconscious processes.**

But the Old Brain isn't just running on ancient code; it's continually
evolving and adapting.

## Learned Experiences and Intuition

While we often think of the Old Brain as purely primal and instinctive,
it doesn't operate solely on hardwired survival patterns. From early
childhood, it absorbs experiences, lessons, and cultural norms, layering
them on top of its basic programming. Think of it this way: we're born
with a set of core instincts, but our upbringing, environment, and
beliefs, whether passed down from parents or picked up from society,
help "finish the baking." By adulthood, the large Old Brain gear has
been shaped and refined by everything we've soaked up along the way.

**Here's how it all comes together:**

## Real-World Experiences

Touch a hot stove once, and your Old Brain locks in that memory. You
don't do it again, not because you've reasoned it out with your New
Brain, but because your Old Brain recalls the pain. Each lesson you
learn adds another tooth to that big gear, ensuring it turns with the
caution or confidence the situation demands.

## Cognitive Heuristics

Over time, you develop various mental shortcuts, what psychologists
refer to as "heuristics", to make quick decisions without the need for
constant rational deliberation. These well-worn grooves in the larger
gear make it turn more efficiently. When confronted with a familiar
choice, you tend to rely on a rule of thumb rather than painstakingly
weighing every pro and con.

## Intuition

As these experiences accumulate, you develop a gut feeling about
things---a sense of "knowing" without conscious reasoning. That's
intuition. It's like the hum of the Old Brain's engine, operating on
everything you've seen, done, or felt. Intuition stems from the Old
Brain's constant activity, its gears driven by an ever-expanding
reservoir of learned wisdom.

All these experiences and lessons ultimately form the foundation of your
belief system---your worldview. While the New Brain may intervene to
rationalize or reflect, the Old Brain is the first to react, equipped
with all the memories, instincts, and heuristics it has amassed over a
lifetime. The outcome? A powerful, learned mechanism that shapes who you
are and how you respond when life comes at you quickly.

## Decisions are made in the Old Brain First

This is not just hyperbole but essential to understanding and applying
the Divided Brain framework.

Brain imaging studies increasingly demonstrate that the Old Brain often
makes decisions before we are aware, and our consciousness in the New
Brain may serve as a "notification" rather than being the actual
decision-maker.

An eye-opening example comes from an experiment by John-Dylan Haynes1^
at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in
Germany, described in a study published in Nature Neuroscience. Haynes
and his team utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a
method that enables researchers to observe the brain in real time,
correlating mental tasks or stimuli with their fundamental neural
circuits, to forecast participants' decisions up to **seven seconds
before they reported being aware of them.**

The task was straightforward---participants could press a button with
either hand at their discretion, but needed to indicate the moment they
believed they had made a decision. By examining patterns of brain
activity, the researchers could predict which hand participants would
choose significantly ahead of their conscious awareness recognition.

But pressing a left or right button isn't exactly rocket science, so
Haynes's team investigated further. They designed another study that
involved adding or subtracting two numbers, which required more abstract
thinking than a simple button press. Again, using fMRI to monitor
real-time brain activity, they could predict how participants would
decide before they actually reported making the choice. The conclusion?
Even for more complex decisions, our unconscious neural processes might
do the heavy lifting, leaving our conscious mind to catch up later.

Whether it's selecting a latte flavour or figuring out how to solve a
math problem, these findings suggest that the brain's ancient machinery
(our "Old Brain," as we refer to it) often initiates actions and
intentions long before our "New Brain" becomes aware of them. Rather
than being eerie science fiction, this research highlights a fundamental
truth:

**Much of our decision-making operates on autopilot, surfacing into
awareness only after the fact has occurred.**

And while that might rattle our sense of free will, it also offers huge
insights into how brands, leaders, and marketers can better connect with
people by meeting them where decisions are truly made.

## Branding Strategies: Aligning with the Old Brain\'s Momentum

In branding, the key is to align with the momentum of the Old Brain's
larger gear while providing just enough rationale for the New Brain to
support the decision. Since the Old Brain is the dominant gear, brands
must first capture its attention, using emotional storytelling, powerful
imagery, and straightforward, impactful messages that resonate
instinctively.

**Once the Old Brain is engaged and the larger gear turns, the New Brain
can be brought in to validate the decision with logic and reason.**

Consider how successful brands like Coca-Cola or Nike craft their
messaging. They begin by appealing to the Old Brain, evoking feelings of
happiness, belonging, or achievement. The imagery is vivid, the message
is straightforward, and the emotional impact is immediate. This sets the
larger gear turning. Then, they offer just enough information for the
New Brain to latch onto---whether it's about quality, community values,
or product benefits---making it easy for the smaller gear to turn in
harmony with the larger one.

## Wrapping It Up

As we\'ve seen, the Old Brain is the powerhouse, its large gear spinning
with the swift, primal energy of instinct and emotion. It\'s the first
responder, the unseen hand that often sets our course before we\'re even
consciously aware a decision is underway. If there\'s one truth to etch
into your understanding of human behaviour, it\'s this:

**Decisions are made in the Old Brain first.**

The New Brain then faces the task of either aligning with this powerful
momentum or applying the effort required to shift mental gears. Just
like a manual transmission, it must push in the clutch, ease off the
gas, and deliberately engage its own track. This shift doesn't happen
automatically; it takes conscious intent and energy. But when done
effectively, it can guide the decision in a new direction, which we'll
delve into more deeply in Chapters 5, 6 and 7.

This is where savvy branding comes into play. The most effective
strategies honour this dynamic: first, they **captivate the Old Brain**,
forging an immediate, emotional connection. Only then do they **engage
the New Brain**, offering the logic and rationale needed to seal the
deal and build lasting conviction.

Mastering this intricate dance between the gears---and knowing when to
shift---is the key to messaging that doesn't just get noticed, but gets
felt and remembered. It's about respecting the raw power of our ancient
instincts while artfully enlisting our modern intellect, creating a
harmonious flow from gut feeling to reasoned action.

But what are the specific, pre-programmed responses that make this Old
Brain so influential? Evolution has hardwired it with a set of default
tendencies that fire instantly, shaping our reactions at a subconscious
level. It's time to pull back the curtain on these foundational traits.
Let's explore the Old Brain's default operating system.

# **Chapter 4: Default Old Brain Responses**

**"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life
and you will call it fate."**

Carl Jung, psychiatrist

In the last chapter, we explored how the Old Brain is only partly
programmed at birth, with real-life experiences and our environment
completing the wiring. Here, we're shifting focus to what comes
pre-installed: those deep-seated inclinations that drive our habits and
snap decisions, often kicking in before logic or reason has a chance to
engage.

These built-in responses spin the Old Brain's gear into action almost
instantly. Unless we consciously shift mental gears into New Brain mode,
we're likely to stay on autopilot. That gear shift requires effort,
attention, and deliberate control, which is why it's so rarely done.

By understanding these default responses, we gain insight into the
hidden forces that guide our actions, even when those actions don't
appear logical on the surface. And once we can recognize when we're in
automatic versus manual mode, we become better equipped to influence,
communicate, and lead.

## Simplicity

A hallmark of the Old Brain is its preference for the path of least
resistance, it's hard-coded to **conserve energy** and avoid
**unnecessary effort.** This isn\'t laziness; it\'s an evolutionary
masterpiece, honed over millennia to prioritize survival by avoiding
needless effort. This ancient wiring manifests in our impatience with
complexity in today's world.

Have you ever abandoned an online shopping cart mid-purchase? That was
likely your Old Brain recoiling from a clunky, multi-step checkout. It
instinctively steers you away from friction, constantly scanning for the
path of least resistance. For businesses, this is a critical insight: if
your product, message, or process feels like navigating a maze, you're
working against your customers' primal programming. They won\'t just
hesitate; they\'ll often retreat, guided by an unconscious urge for
ease.

This is why winning brands are **masters of simplification.** They
obsessively streamline every touchpoint, from crystal-clear website
navigation and transparent pricing to one-click checkouts. They pave a
smooth runway for the Old Brain, allowing its large gear to turn
effortlessly, guiding decisions without a single snag.

As Leonardo da Vinci aptly put it:

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."**

In the following chapters, we will revisit "simplicity" many times. It's
a cornerstone of understanding the Old Brain and countless lost
opportunities in branding and business.

*[Example:]* Our KICX-branded stations played country music.
Country music fans are drawn to songs that tell stories about everyday
life, including its joys and challenges. Keeping that message simple
helped our brand cut through. The Canadian Country Music Association
named KICX 106 Country Music Station of the Year eight times.

**Communication Strategy for Old Brain Simplicity:**

**- Simplify your message:** Use clear, straightforward language. The
Old Brain prefers concise, digestible information. Streamlining your
customer journey can significantly boost conversions.

**- Create familiar patterns:** Use predictable layouts and intuitive
design. The Old Brain is drawn to clarity and comfort, avoid clutter
or complexity that deters engagement.

**- Encourage habits:** Reinforce routine behaviours through loyalty
programs, regular updates, or subscriptions. Once a habit forms, the
Old Brain sticks with it effortlessly.

## Needs Immediate Gratification

Another core trait of the Old Brain is its powerful craving for instant
rewards. In our evolutionary past, waiting too long for food or shelter
could mean missing out altogether, so we're programmed to prefer what we
can get right now, rather than holding out for future benefits. This
built-in FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) scarcity bias (covered in
Chapter 6) explains why we often falter on long-term goals like saving
money or sticking to a diet: the promise of immediate pleasure almost
always wins out over distant rewards.

Marketers understand this instinct well. That's why urgency
tactics---flash sales, countdown timers, and "limited-time offers"---are
so effective. They speak directly to the Old Brain's impulsive side,
making it hard to resist acting in the moment. Just think of Amazon's
"Order now, get it tomorrow" prompt: it's a masterclass in tapping into
our drive for instant gratification and quick results.

*[Example:]* Shopee's 2024 "Shocking Sale"1^ events
illustrate how countdown timers can spike impulse buying. Academic
studies on Shopee's flash-sale features report significant jumps in
unplanned purchases---sometimes doubling baseline cart sizes---whenever
a strict time limit is displayed.

**Communication Strategy for Immediate Gratification:**

**- Highlight instant benefits:** Focus on what the customer gains
immediately from your product or service.

**- Use urgency tactics:** Limited-time offers, fast shipping, or
instant downloads trigger that need for immediate satisfaction.

**- Simplify the purchasing process:** Make buying fast and easy. The
fewer steps between wanting something and getting it, the better.

## Resistant to Change

The survivalist Old Brain hates change because change equates to
uncertainty, and uncertainty can be dangerous. This is why even positive
changes, like starting a new fitness routine or switching to a better
product, often feel uncomfortable initially. Remember how stressful your
first house purchase was?

When introducing something new, it's essential to ease people into it.

Because the Old Brain is like a large gear with significant momentum, it
is naturally resistant to change. You'll need to demonstrate how your
new product or service enhances their lives without overwhelming them.

*[Example:]* When Instagram introduced Stories, they
modelled the feature after Snapchat\'s popular format. By framing it as
an enhancement to an existing platform rather than an entirely new
concept, Instagram reduced resistance and encouraged users to adopt the
new feature more easily.

**Communication Strategy for Resistance to Change:**

**- Position Change as an Enhancement:** Frame new products or updates
as improvements to existing solutions rather than entirely new
offerings.

**- Provide Reassurance:** Use testimonials and case studies to show
how others have successfully made the change.

**- Offer Trials or Demos:** Allow customers to experience the new
offering risk-free to reduce the fear of the unknown.

## It's Selfish

This Old Brain's deep-seated focus on self-preservation means it is
inherently "selfish" in its initial processing. It subconsciously and
instantly asks, "What's in it for me?" whenever confronted with choices
or information.

**In marketing, you risk losing their attention if you don't quickly
demonstrate how your product directly benefits the customer.**

The Old Brain's focus on immediate rewards further amplifies this
selfish streak. It often prioritizes short-term personal gains, even if
that means overlooking the bigger picture or the needs of others. This
is why impulse purchases and temptations can be so hard to resist: the
Old Brain is always looking for quick satisfaction, **putting the self
first by default.**

*[Example:]* Loyalty programs like Starbucks Rewards
encourage customers to earn points with each purchase, which can be
redeemed for free items.

**Communication Strategy for Selfish Behaviour:**

**- Emphasize Personal Benefits:** Clearly articulate how your product
or service meets the customer\'s individual needs and desires.

**- Address Pain Points Directly:** Show understanding of the
customer\'s challenges and present your offering as the solution.

**- Use Exclusive Offers:** Make customers feel special with
personalized deals or early access to new products.

## Wants to be Part of a Tribe

You might wonder---if the Old Brain is so self-focused, how does it also
drive us to cooperate? The answer is that while the Old Brain's first
instinct is self-preservation, it quickly recognizes that **belonging to
a group** can improve individual survival. Over time, our ancestors
learned that forming strong group identities---tribes---meant access
to shared resources, collective protection, and a greater chance of
surviving and thriving.

*[Example:]* Apple's 'Get a Mac' campaign (2006--2009) cast
Mac as cool, casual, and user-friendly---opposite the stiff, outdated PC
persona. By using relatable characters and humour, Apple tapped into
social identity, making Mac the more appealing choice.

Our ancestors learned to cooperate by forging strong group
identities---remaining loyal to those who looked and acted like them
while cautiously viewing outsiders. Our Old Brain, by default, offers
deeper empathy and support for the people in our own tribe, but it often
displays less compassion for those outside it. This same dynamic makes
politics so polarizing and sports rivalries so thrilling: we rally
fiercely around our team while gleefully booing "them." That sense of
belonging can work wonders for your brand.

**If you create a brand community---a tribe---where your customers feel
they truly belong, they'll form a bond that's nearly impossible to
break.**

Once they see themselves as part of your in-group, they'll stick with
you through thick and thin, proudly championing your values and sharing
your message as their own.

Our hardwired tribal instincts will take centre stage in Chapter 6, when
we explore many of our **cognitive biases**. You'll see just how deeply
group identity shapes the way we think, feel, and decide.

**Communication Strategy for Tribalism:**

- Invite customers to join your exclusive club, making them feel
connected and unique, much like the Harley Owners Group (HOG), which
celebrates a passion for riding.

- Provide exclusive offers to tribe members, appealing to the Old
Brain\'s preference for exclusive groups of like-minded individuals.

- To help tribe members identify with the brand, offer branded
merchandise such as mugs and apparel at no or low cost.

## Wants Fairness

Our sense of fairness isn't just learned---it's hardwired. Many animals,
not just humans, display instincts of justice, reciprocity, and equity.
Some birds, for instance, warn others of predators even at personal
risk, hinting at evolved mutual protection systems.

A striking example comes from primatologist Frans de Waal's famous
capuchin monkey experiment. In a [viral YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg), two monkeys perform
the same task but receive different rewards---one gets a cucumber, the
other a grape. When the first monkey sees the unequal treatment, it
throws a fit, rejecting the cucumber, shaking the bars, even hurling the
food back. Take the time to watch it. It's highly entertaining!

This reaction, called **inequity aversion**, shows fairness is more than
a moral ideal---it's an emotional reflex. De Waal found similar results
with birds, dogs, and chimpanzees. These creatures weren't reacting to
the reward, but to the *difference* in treatment. Fairness, it seems, is
deeply wired into the Old Brain---an evolutionary survival tool for
maintaining cooperation.

So next time you feel slighted by unfair treatment, it's not just social
conditioning---it's biology. In branding, transparency and fairness help
build lasting trust.

**Transparency and fairness will build trust with your audience.**

*[Example:]* Patagonia emphasizes its commitment to ethical
sourcing and environmental sustainability. By being transparent about
their supply chain and ensuring fair labour practices, Patagonia builds
trust and a sense of fairness with their customers, fostering brand
loyalty.

**Communication Strategy for Fairness:**

**- Maintain Transparency:** Be open about pricing, policies, and the
value proposition to build trust.

**- Ensure Consistency:** Provide all customers with equal service
quality to avoid perceptions of unfair treatment.

**- Encourage Community Feedback:** Allow customers to share reviews
and testimonials, fostering a sense of shared fairness.

## Dislikes too Much Choice

Barry Schwartz's book *The Paradox of Choice* (2004) references an
experiment that illustrates how choice overload can impede
decision-making. In psychologist Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper's
experiment,3^ consumers were presented with a tasting booth offering
either 24 varieties of jam or just 6. The more extensive selection
attracted more attention, but only 3% of those consumers actually made a
purchase. In contrast, 30% of consumers exposed to the smaller selection
bought jam, suggesting that too many choices can hinder decision-making.

The Old Brain likes to have some choice---or at least the feeling of
choosing---but finds too many variables confusing (see **Craves the
Familiar** later in this chapter). It prefers choices to be
straightforward. Too many options can be overwhelming, particularly if
there's no simple way to sort them by relevance.

This is why the golden rule of user experience design is **"don't make
me think,"** reflecting our preference for easy decisions.

[Example:] *Netflix offers personalized recommendations
rather than overwhelming users with every available show and movie. By
categorizing content and highlighting specific recommendations, Netflix
makes it easier for users to choose without feeling overwhelmed by too
many options.*

**Communication Strategy for the Paradox of Choice:**

**- Limit Options:** Offer a curated selection of products or services
to simplify decision-making.

**- Categorize Products:** Organize your offerings into clear
categories to help customers easily navigate their choices.

**- Highlight Recommendations:** Use bestsellers or staff picks to
guide customers toward popular choices.

**- Simplify Decision Paths:** Reduce the steps or choices required to
complete an action or purchase.

## Craves the Familiar

Unfamiliar situations introduce uncertainty, and as we know, the Old
Brain treats uncertainty as a potential threat. Moreover, engaging with
something unfamiliar requires more cognitive resources, which the Old
Brain shuns. And finally, the Old Brain's neurotransmitters (which we'll
cover in detail in Chapter 8) reinforce familiar behaviours by making
them feel comfortable and satisfying. As a result, the Old Brain guides
us toward what we already know, as it feels safer, easier, and more
rewarding than the unfamiliar.

*[Example:]* Our DOCK-branded stations played the Greatest
Hits. If you grew up in our target demographic years, every song should
be familiar and bring you back to a happy place. At our launch, we
positioned the station as "Comfort Food for Your Ears."

You can't get more familiar than that.

From a branding and business perspective, **familiarity---or the lack of
it---is one of the most overlooked forces in marketing**. When working
with new clients, I often hear the same refrain: *"We don't want to be
like everybody else."* While originality is important, this mindset can
lead to a **catastrophic error**---confusing unfamiliarity with
differentiation. If your brand feels too foreign or unpredictable,
people don't see it as innovative; they see it as risky. That's why
I devote an entire chapter to this crucial insight later in the book
(see Chapter 10). Understanding how familiarity influences trust,
likability, and decision-making can make the difference between a brand
that sticks---and one that never gets noticed.

**Communication Strategy for Familiarity:**

**- Build Brand Consistency:** Use consistent branding elements like
logos, colours, and messaging across all platforms.

**- Leverage Nostalgia:** Incorporate elements that remind customers
of positive past experiences.

**- Use Familiar Imagery:** Use easily recognizable and relatable
visuals for your target audience.

**- Align with Cultural Norms:** Be mindful of cultural references and
practices to ensure your brand feels familiar to different
demographics.

## Likes Novelty in Small Doses

The Old Brain is receptive to new experiences and surprises, but only in
small doses. It is critical to remember this when communicating with the
Old Brain. While new experiences can be exciting and stimulating, they
also carry uncertainty and potential risks. Evolutionarily, unfamiliar
situations could signal danger, so the Old Brain cautiously approaches
novelty.

**Small doses of novelty allow the Old Brain to explore and learn
without becoming overwhelmed or harming us.**

This balance between curiosity and caution enabled early humans to adapt
to new environments and challenges while minimizing risks. Therefore,
the Old Brain prefers novelty in manageable amounts, where it can enjoy
stimulation without being swamped by excessive new information.

Just as we explored the power of familiarity, novelty---what sets
you apart---will be unpacked in depth in Chapter 10. You will learn that
it's not enough to be different for the sake of it; understanding how to
strike the right balance between the familiar and the fresh is key to
capturing attention without triggering resistance.

*[Example:]* Starbucks often introduces seasonal drinks,
like the Pumpkin Spice Latte, to provide a limited amount of novelty.
These small, time-limited changes keep the brand exciting while not
overwhelming customers with too much change at once.

**Communication Strategies for Novelty in Small Doses:**

**- Introduce Change Gradually:** Roll out new features or updates
incrementally to allow customers to adjust.

**- Blend New with Old:** Combine new offerings with familiar elements
to ease the transition.

**- Create Limited-Time Experiences:** Offer short-term promotions or
events to introduce novelty without a long-term commitment.

**- Use Teasers:** Build anticipation with sneak peeks or previews
that generate interest without overwhelming.

## Needs Context

The Old Brain requires context because it relies on past experiences and
environmental cues to make quick, intuitive decisions, prioritizing
safety and survival. Context provides a framework for interpreting
situations, allowing the brain to assess whether something is familiar,
safe, or potentially threatening rapidly.

**Without context, the Old Brain would struggle to differentiate between
harmless and dangerous situations.**

This could potentially lead to unnecessary fear or, worse, failure to
recognize real threats. By understanding the context, the Old Brain can
quickly determine how to react, utilizing instinctive and automatic
responses that have evolved over time.

We will revisit this need for context in Chapter 6 when we discuss the
Anchoring bias to which we are all susceptible.

*[Example:]* When Joshua Bell, one of the world\'s greatest
violinists, played his multimillion-dollar Stradivarius incognito as a
social experiment in a Washington, D.C., Metro station in 2007, most
commuters hurried past without recognizing his exceptional talent.
Without the context of a concert hall and the cues that signal a
performance worth attending, the Old Brain failed to appreciate the
quality of his music. Take time to watch this on
[YouTube.](https://youtu.be/hnOPu0_YWhw?si=SUVoXXB4qyD4pX6j)4^

**Communication Strategy for Context:**

**- Set the Scene:** Provide background information that helps
customers understand the relevance of your message.

**- Use Storytelling:** Craft narratives that place your product or
service within a familiar and relatable context (see Chapter 11).

**- Provide Visual Context:** Use images and videos that show your
product in use within everyday situations.

**- Align Messaging with Environment:** Tailor your communication to
fit the platform or medium where it will be received.

## Needs Resolution

**Knock knock?**

What comes to your mind? Likely, "Who's there?" That's the Old Brain
pushing for a quick resolution.

The Old Brain dislikes being left hanging. It requires immediate
resolution due to its advanced ability to provide us with lightning-fast
information, which often makes the difference between life and death.

Unfortunately, this urgency for resolution leads to errors in judgment.
This can lead to snap decisions based on incomplete information,
resulting in cognitive biases and faulty reasoning. While quick thinking
can be beneficial in certain situations, it often hinders our ability to
consider complex issues thoroughly. Recognizing this tendency can help
the New Brain pause, reflect, and make more informed choices, even if
our Old Brain pushes for immediate resolution answers.

*[Example:]* Domino\'s Pizza Tracker provides real-time
updates on the status of your order, from preparation to delivery. This
clear progression provides immediate closure and reduces uncertainty,
fulfilling the Old Brain\'s need for resolution and encouraging customer
satisfaction.

**Communication Strategies for Resolution:**

**- No Confusion:** Ensure your marketing materials do not leave room
for confusion or questions. This frustrates the Old Brain.

**- Help in Resolve:** Your product or service's marketing materials
should always point to resolving the customer's pain points. Your Old
Brain will release neurotransmitters like endorphins when it resolves.

**- User Experience:** Make sure any interaction or touchpoints in the
branding do not leave people hanging. How do you feel when a company's
website brings you to a "Page Not Found" banner when it should have
brought you to what it promised?

## It's Vain

Often dismissed as superficial, vanity is ingrained in the Old Brain's
evolution. In ancient times, appearance signalled survival; a healthy
glow or strong physique indicated fertility and access to resources,
crucial for reproduction and community status. Individuals who exhibited
these traits gained an advantage in social and mating hierarchies.

While we label its modern form as "vanity," this drive explains our
desire for self-improvement, social validation, and standing out.

**This instinct is deeply ingrained in our subconscious, even though our
New Brain will deny it.**

Whether it's a quick mirror check before a presentation or the pride in
vacation photos on social media, vanity influences more decisions than
we admit.

**The Need for Self-Esteem**

Vanity stems from our desire for self-esteem, linked to our **ego: our
sense of worth.** The ego filters how the Old Brain interprets the
world, maintaining a flattering self-narrative. When the New Brain tries
to analyze, if it challenges our ego, it's like a small gear resisting
the Old Brain's speed. The Old Brain seldom yields, particularly when it
comes to self-preservation and pride.

The paradox of self-esteem is that it often involves others, not just
the "self". We often think we're making decisions as individuals, but in
reality, we're casting a vote with our Old Brain---for the tribe we want
to belong to and the identity we want others to see. These choices
aren't purely logical---they're **emotional declarations.**

**Social Identity**

We rarely make purchasing decisions in isolation. Whether we realize it
or not, we're constantly signalling to others. The Old Brain isn't just
wired for survival---it's wired for *social survival*. That means
**status, belonging, and reputation** matter deeply.

When we buy a luxury watch, choose an eco-friendly car, or wear a
particular brand of shoes, we're doing more than satisfying a
need---we're broadcasting identity. These choices say, "This is who I
am," or more often, "This is the tribe I want to be part of." The Old
Brain drives these decisions because, throughout human evolution, being
accepted by a group increased our chances of survival. Today, that
instinct plays out through brands.

We might tell ourselves we chose something for its features or price,
but that logic often arrives *after* the emotional decision is already
made. The car, the phone, the bag---it's not just a product. It's a
costume we put on to tell the world our story. Remember my Rolex?

**Communication Strategies for Vanity:**

**- Appeal to Attractiveness:** Use messaging and imagery that
directly address the desire for beauty and confidence.

*[Example:]* A skincare brand promoting "flawless, radiant
skin" taps into the intrinsic appeal of attractiveness.

**- Highlight Aspirational Goals:** Showcase products or services as
tools for transformation and self-improvement.

*[Example:]* Campaigns like "Transform Your Body in 30 Days"
tap into the desire for physical and personal improvement.

**- Emphasize Exclusivity:** Position your product or service as a
status symbol.

*[Example:]* Luxury goods, such as high-end watches or cars,
emphasize craftsmanship and exclusivity, appealing to the consumer's
desire to project success.

## It's Thin-Skinned

As social creatures, our ancestors relied on group acceptance for
survival. Exclusion led to vulnerability and limited resources. Thus,
the Old Brain evolved heightened sensitivity to social cues and
opinions, keeping us attuned and integrated. This legacy manifests today
as fear of judgment or rejection, making our Old Brain \'thin-skinned\'
to social threats. Seeking approval, worrying over negative reviews, or
overanalyzing interactions stems from this hyperawareness, driving daily
anxiety and decisions.

In today's world, social media exacerbates this sensitivity with likes,
comments, and visibility feeding our need for validation. The Old Brain
seeks reassurance of a positive perception, linking it to feelings of
safety and belonging. Understanding this reaction is crucial for
businesses to build trust, foster connections, and avoid alienating
consumers.

**Try This Exercise: Spotting the Old Brain**

1\. Choose a recent purchase or decision you made impulsively. Write
it down.

2\. Identify the Old Brain responses that drove this decision (e.g.,
immediate gratification, familiarity, vanity, simplicity).

3\. Reflect briefly: did your New Brain rationalize this choice
afterward? How?

4\. Next time you're about to make a similar impulse decision, pause
for five seconds and ask, "Which Old Brain response is active right
now?" Notice how this awareness impacts your decision-making.

## Wrapping It Up

After reading this chapter, you might think I'm describing a
three-year-old rather than the default traits of the Old Brain. And you
wouldn't be wrong. **Toddlers live almost entirely in the realm of the
Old Brain**, driven by instinct, emotion, and impulse. Their New
Brain---the part responsible for logic, self-control, and delayed
gratification---is still under construction.

Understanding the Old Brain's default settings isn't just a
psychological curiosity---it's a powerful tool for connection. When we
tailor our communication to match its preferences---simplicity,
familiarity, emotional impact, and immediate rewards---we unlock more
engaging, persuasive, and effective interactions.

Notably, many of our **cognitive biases,** which we'll cover in Chapter
6, stem directly from these Old Brain reflexes.

But first, in the next chapter, we'll focus on the **New Brain**---how
it rationalizes, reframes, and sometimes wrestles with the impulses of
its older, louder sibling. Together, they shape every decision we make,
often in surprising ways.

# **Chapter 5: The New Brain**

**"The frontal cortex is the part of the brain that makes you do the
harder thing when it's the right thing to do."**

Robert Sapolsky, professor of neurology and neurosurgery

**Not every decision is made in the heat of the moment.** Sometimes,
real progress begins when we shift gears---when we slow down, reflect,
and consciously take control. This is where the New Brain comes in.
Unlike the relentless Old Brain---always scanning for shortcuts,
threats, and quick wins---the New Brain turns more deliberately, with
the precision of a manual shift into a higher mode of thinking. It
calculates risks, explores new angles, and invents what's next.

It's this inner engineer that lets us break from automatic patterns,
challenge assumptions, and envision long-term strategies. Whether you're
charting a new business path, navigating a personal crisis, or simply
reimagining what's possible, you're shifting your mind into
manual---engaging the quieter gear of deliberate thought.

In the early 2000s, I launched a radio station in Kitchener, Ontario,
with a minority partner. Eighteen months in, that "partner" triggered a
shotgun clause in our agreement, forcing me to come up with \$8 million
in thirty days---or walk away. I didn't have the money. I couldn't
borrow it. I sat in a coffee shop, stomach in knots, convinced I was
about to lose everything.

My first instinct was pure Old Brain: panic. The threat felt immediate
and overwhelming. Too many unknowns. Too much at risk. But then
something shifted---literally. I took my mental foot off the gas, pushed
in the cognitive clutch, and eased into a different gear.

I grabbed a napkin and started sketching---not drawings, but decisions.
I mapped out worst-case outcomes, resources I still had, what I might do
next. It was messy, full of arrows, scribbles, and crossed-out plans.
But eventually, something coherent began to emerge. Not a reflex, but a
roadmap. A response.

Looking back, this wasn't instinct---it was my New Brain in manual mode.
That napkin was my **shifting lever**. By stepping out of reactive
autopilot, I activated my capacity to pause, reflect, and build a future
that didn't yet exist. That's the gift of metacognition, covered
later in the Chapter. Animals can fight or flee. But we can pause,
simulate, and reimagine. All it takes is a mental gearshift---and
sometimes, a pen and a napkin.

As for how it ended? That's a story for another day. But what felt like
the worst moment of my career turned out to be the best.

So, whether you're navigating a turning point, a challenge, or a
creative block, don't just react---shift. Let that slower, wiser gear
take over. That's where growth happens. That's where strategy lives.

## Characteristics of the Smaller Gear

Again, the New Brain represents the latest upgrade in our mental
software. It's our "conscious" brain---the smaller gear---that doesn't
spin on its own. It requires deliberate effort, like shifting into
manual transmission. Compared to the lightning-fast, automatic nature of
the Old Brain, the New Brain is energy-consuming, inefficient, and slow.
That's why we can't truly multitask (more on that later), or entertain
more than one complex thought at a time.

But it's this very gear---the one that requires effort to engage---that
makes us uniquely human. When we intentionally shift into it, we access
a range of capabilities that no other species can match:

**- Think and Plan:** Crafting strategies, setting goals, and
envisioning the future requires the focused turning of the smaller
gear, which moves deliberately but with precision.

**- Judge and Solve Problems:** Analyzing situations, weighing
options, and finding solutions involves the smaller gear engaging
deeply, requiring effort to influence the larger gear\'s automatic
responses.

**- Conceptualizing and Thinking Abstractly:** Grasping complex ideas
unrelated to physical objects is a function of the smaller gear
turning thoughtfully, allowing us to understand abstract concepts that
the Old Brain cannot process.

**- Use Language and Communicate:** Expressing thoughts through spoken
and written words relies on the New Brain, the smaller gear that turns
slowly but effectively to convey meaning.

**- Practice Metacognition:** Covered later in this chapter,
reflecting on our own thinking, questioning our beliefs, and changing
our minds---these are uniquely human capabilities enabled by the
deliberate work of the New Brain.

**- Stores Short-Term Memory:** The New Brain acts like your mental
desktop---holding information temporarily while you actively work with
it. Also called working memory, it is conscious, limited, and
short-lived, handling only a few pieces of information at once before
either discarding them or passing them on for deeper storage.

## The New Kid on the Block

Imagine standing in front of a dessert table, eyeing a rich, gooey slice
of chocolate cake. Your Old Brain doesn't hesitate---it screams, *"Eat
it now!"* But then your New Brain quietly taps you on the shoulder:
*"What about your health goals?"* And just like that, a tug-of-war
begins. The larger gear is already in motion, driven by impulse and
reward. The New Brain, smaller and slower, has to work hard to apply the
brakes and change course.

As we've seen, the **New Brain is a very recent arrival** in
evolutionary terms---brand new compared to the ancient machinery it's
trying to manage. No wonder it struggles for control. It's like a junior
pilot learning to steer a jumbo jet already mid-flight. The Old Brain
has been running the show for half a billion years; the New Brain is
still catching up.

Yet in that gap---in that tension---is where our most human traits
emerge: **self-control, reflection, long-term thinking, and
imagination**. Learning to strengthen this newer gear doesn't mean
silencing the Old Brain---it means knowing when to override it, when to
work with it, and how to steer both systems toward better outcomes.

## New Brain Can't Multitask

The New Brain is focused, deliberate, and linear---unlike the Old Brain,
which can juggle multiple inputs instinctively. The New Brain excels at
deep work but falters when faced with distractions. What feels like
multitasking is rapid task-switching, draining cognitive resources and
increasing errors. Each shift taxes its limited bandwidth---not just in
attention, but in short-term memory, which can only hold a few pieces of
information at once. You've seen this in action: checking email during a
meeting or toggling tabs while trying to write. For marketers and
leaders, the message is clear: keep communications simple. Engage the
Old Brain's instincts, but support the New Brain with structured,
easy-to-digest messaging.

## Special Pleading

By now, it should be clear that decisions originate in the Old
Brain---automatically, emotionally, and often without our awareness.
That's the big gear turning on its own. Most of the time, we don't even
realize we've made a choice until we're already acting on it.

We now know that once the Old Brain commits, often the New Brain steps
in---not to question, **but to justify**. The New Brain rarely applies
the brakes unless we deliberately shift into manual mode. Instead, it
builds rational-sounding explanations to support the decision already
made. Psychologists call this post hoc rationalizing **special
pleading**1^---excusing behaviour in ourselves that we wouldn't accept
from others, all to protect our ego and avoid discomfort.

**The Press Secretary Analogy**

One of the best illustrations of this mental manoeuvre comes from
Jonathan Haidt's *The Happiness Hypothesis* (2006). He likens the New
Brain to a **government press secretary**---quick with explanations,
smooth with words, and always ready to defend the leader's actions, no
matter what happened behind closed doors.

The Old Brain makes the decision. The New Brain steps up to the
microphone and says, "Here's why that was the right choice." The
beauty---and danger---of this setup is that the New Brain actually
believes the story it's telling. It feels like we're reasoning things
out when, in fact, we're just *rationalizing* them after the fact.

This is why we're so good at making exceptions for ourselves---whether
it's eating that slice of cake after swearing off sugar or justifying a
risky business move we'd advise others against. We tell ourselves, "This
time is different," or "I had no choice," or "It was the right call
under the circumstances." That's **special pleading** in action: bending
logic to serve an emotional decision we've already made.

*[Example:]* A customer walks into a dealership and falls in
love with a high-end sports car. The Old Brain lights up: It's sleek.
It's powerful. It makes me feel successful. The decision is already made
emotionally. But then the New Brain gets to work with the special
pleading: "It gets good mileage for its class," "It holds its value," or
"It's a smart business write-off." None of those rational points are
what drove the decision, but they're the New Brain **narrative
scaffolding** we build afterward to make the choice feel reasonable,
even strategic.

Understanding this mechanism---especially as a marketer, founder, or
brand strategist---lets you design messaging that speaks directly to the
Old Brain's emotional instincts, while also giving the New Brain the
logical language it needs to feel good about saying yes.

By now, you're likely seeing the pattern: the Old Brain makes the
decision first, and the New Brain rushes in after the fact to explain or
defend it. That's special pleading. But what happens when the Old Brain
gets it wrong---when it chooses comfort over values, or novelty over
necessity?

That's when the New Brain needs to shift gears---**literally.** It must
move out of automatic mode and into manual control, overriding the Old
Brain's momentum. This isn't passive; it requires conscious effort,
focus, and the mental energy to push in the clutch, shift gears, and
redirect the decision.

Let's delve into exactly how we do that.

## Metacognition: The New Brain's Super Power

When the New Brain manages to push back against the Old Brain's
automatic impulses, it taps into one of our most uniquely human
abilities. Psychologists call this **metacognition,**2^ evaluating and
analyzing our cognitive abilities---**thinking about thinking.** It's
how we override reflex with reflection.

This capability allows us to monitor and assess our own mental
processes. It's what enables the smaller gear to pause, shift out of
automatic, and engage manual control. In that moment, the New Brain
steps on the clutch, eases off the mental gas, and shifts into
deliberate mode, asking: "Wait---how did I arrive at this conclusion?"

Just as driving a stick shift requires practice and effort, this kind of
cognition also demands **practice and effort.** But it's the only way to
truly steer your behaviour, rather than being steered by it.

Instead of blindly rationalizing Old Brain decisions, metacognition
gives us the power to interrogate them---to apply focused reasoning
*before* endorsing the emotional reaction. It's the mechanism that helps
us learn from mistakes, update our strategies, and make better long-term
choices.

So next time you catch yourself making a snap decision, treat
metacognition like a **mental gear shift:**

- "Am I acting on instinct or reason?"

- "What emotions are driving this choice?"

- "What assumptions am I making?"

- "Why do I believe this is the right move?"

These prompts activate the New Brain's deeper systems. They help you
shift from **reactive autopilot to intentional control**---aligning your
decisions with long-term values, not just short-term impulses.

## How to Engage Metacognition in Branding

Engaging the New Brain effectively means shifting your messaging into
*manual mode:* **metacognition,** to help with logic, critical thinking
(see Chapter 7), and long-term planning.

The New Brain thrives on clarity, coherence, and meaningful structure.
To engage it, you must present your brand in a way that rewards focused
attention and satisfies the need for rational validation. Here are some
practical strategies for shifting into that gear and keeping the New
Brain engaged:

**1. Spark Curiosity:** The New Brain enjoys challenges and questions.
*How:* Pose thoughtful questions or puzzles to invite reflection.

*[Example:]* "What's your carbon footprint?" prompts
critical thinking in ads.

**2. Highlight Rational Benefits:** The New Brain wants to understand
*why* something works. *How:* Explain features, functionality, and
logic.

*[Example:]* A car brand promoting fuel economy and safety
stats.

**3. Allow Time to Reflect**: The New Brain prefers thoughtful
decision-making. *How:* Offer demos, trials, or no-pressure timelines.

*[Example:]* Software with a 14-day trial for full
exploration.

**4. Promote Learning and Growth**: The New Brain craves knowledge and
progress. *How:* Offer educational tools or skill-building content.

*[Example:]* Brands hosting webinars or tutorials. Or
offering a free downloadable PDF of practical tips.

**Why It Matters**

Engaging the New Brain isn't about flooding it with facts---it's about
shifting into the right gear for thoughtful navigation. While the Old
Brain is like cruising in automatic---fast, effortless, and
instinctive---the New Brain demands a manual shift. It requires you to
ease off the gas, press the clutch, and deliberately guide your thinking
forward.

By honouring the deliberate nature of this smaller, more effortful gear,
you unlock more meaningful, precise engagement. And when both
gears---emotion and logic---are activated in sync, your message isn't
just heard. It lands. It lingers. And it drives action.

## Wrapping It Up

Remember: the New Brain is like a finely tuned manual engine. It's
powerful---but it won't run on autopilot. It takes effort to activate,
focus to sustain, and practice to shift into deliberately. And just like
driving a stick shift, you have to know when to slow down, how to switch
gears, and why it matters.

Yes, it's slower. Yes, it burns more mental fuel. And it's also where
your short-term memory lives---meaning your working space is limited.
Trying to do too much at once **clogs the system** and stalls progress.
But with metacognition---your ability to think about your own
thinking---you gain access to one of your most advanced human faculties.
You begin to notice your mental patterns, catch your biases, and
course-correct before the Old Brain steers you into a ditch.

In summary, when you intentionally shift into New Brain mode, you gain
the ability to:

**- Question Assumptions**: Catch yourself in the act and redirect
your thinking.

**- Analyze Evidence**: Make slower, smarter, more grounded decisions.

**- Solve Complex Problems**: Break old patterns and design
forward-thinking solutions.

So take the wheel. Embrace your inner gear shifter. When you understand
how and when to transition from automatic to manual, you'll make
decisions that aren't just emotionally compelling---but rationally rock
solid.

In the next chapter, we'll go one gear further---exploring what happens
when the New Brain doesn't just defend the Old Brain's choices, but
rewrites the entire story...

# **Chapter 6: Errors in Thinking**

**"What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new
information so that their prior conclusions remain intact."**

Warren Buffett, investor and philanthropist

Ever caught yourself making a snap judgment and later thought**, "What
was I thinking?"**

You're not alone. As marvellous as our minds are, they come with
quirks---especially when the gears of the Old Brain and New Brain fall
out of sync.

I'll never forget one particular business trip. My flight had just
landed, I was late for a meeting, and I rushed straight to the baggage
claim. As soon as a black suitcase slid past on the carousel, I grabbed
it and bolted for the taxi line. It wasn't until I was outside, standing
in the cold, that I realized---this wasn't my bag. Same size, same
shape, even a similar tag... but definitely not mine.

In my rush, my Old Brain was in full automatic mode. The large gear spun
fast, making a familiar snap judgment: *That's yours---go!* No time for
checks. No room for doubt. It acted instinctively, just as it was
designed to. Only once I slowed down---standing still in the taxi
line---did the smaller gear kick in. My New Brain shifted into manual.
That's when I recognized the mistake. It cost me 30 minutes and a
scramble to return the wrong bag.

It's a small slip---but a perfect demonstration of how our thinking can
derail when we're operating entirely on automatic. In life, business,
branding---even in everyday decisions---this happens constantly. The Old
Brain charges ahead, and unless we deliberately downshift, the New Brain
may never engage.

The good news? You can learn to recognize when your instincts are in
overdrive. And with practice, you can push in the mental clutch, ease
off the gas, and **consciously shift gears.** That's when better
decisions happen---ones that serve your long-term goals, not just your
momentary reflexes.

Let's explore why these thinking errors occur---and how understanding
them can transform how you lead, persuade, and build a brand that
actually connects.

## Default Automatic Transmission

**Picture this:** you're scrolling social media, see a headline that
confirms your belief, and instantly like or share it. Later, you learn
the story was false. That's your Old Brain flooring it in automatic,
while your New Brain never got into gear.

What happened? Your brain stayed in automatic transmission mode. No time
to verify---just emotion and a fast decision.

But that's not a bug. It's how we're built. The Old Brain makes
split-second decisions with limited data using
inference1^---filling in gaps based on memory, context, or
experience. It's useful, but also where bias begins.

**The takeaway:** Just because something *feels* right doesn't mean it
*is* right. When our gears fall out of sync and the Old Brain drives
unchecked, we risk poor decisions.

To prevent that, you have to **shift into manual** and engage the New
Brain. It takes effort, but it will be more accurate and robust when
used with intention.

The more you practise this gear shift, the better you'll get at
separating reflex from reflection. And that's where **absolute clarity
begins.**

## Inference: Old Brain Fill-in-the-Blanks

Rather than passively receiving information, the Old Brain jumps in to
interpret---filling gaps, making assumptions, and shaping meaning based
on cues, context, and past experience. It's fast and usually helpful for
survival, but not always accurate.

Inference isn't a bias or fallacy in itself. It's more like the
launchpad for cognitive shortcuts. Once we infer something, we tend to
stop questioning. The Old Brain says, "I've got this," and because it
*feels* true, the New Brain rarely shifts into verify mode.

**That's the danger:** we stay in automatic, coasting on intuition even
when the road gets twisty. Since engaging the New Brain takes
effort---slowing down, pressing the clutch, and shifting gears---we
often don't bother.

That's what makes inference sneaky. It feels natural, not questionable.
But that uncritical acceptance is when biases, blind spots, and bad
conclusions creep in.

One of the most common outcomes of unchecked inference? Our tendency to
see patterns, even when they're not there. This brings us to one of the
most fascinating quirks of the Old Brain: **Patternicity.**

## Pattern Recognition and Patternicity

If Inference is about filling in blanks, Patternicity2^ is
about linking those blanks into a coherent whole. The Old Brain excels
at spotting patterns. When our ancestors heard a rustle in the grass,
assuming it was a predator rather than random wind noise often meant the
difference between life and death. Over time, this protective instinct
trained our brains to treat patterns as **meaningful by default.**

But the pattern-seeking machinery doesn't stop there. It works overtime.

In the modern world, where information bombards us through a firehose,
this ancient survival tool often misfires. Surrounded by complexity,
randomness, and noise, our Old Brain is quick to find connections---even
when they don't exist. That's why we see animal shapes in clouds,
religious figures on toast, or believe in lucky shirts and rituals
before big events. As cognitive scientist Michael Shermer explains3^,
Patternicity is our brain's tendency to create false positives---to
detect meaning where there is only randomness.

## Agency: From Pattern to Purpose

Pattern detection and patternicity don't just stop at shapes or
coincidences---they often extend to **agency.**

Agency is the belief that someone or something acted **with purpose.**
When we detect agency, we assume there's **intent behind what
happened.** You're running late, and every red light feels personal. Is
the universe punishing you for hitting snooze?

The Old Brain doesn't take chances. It's evolved to assume intent,
**just in case.** This shortcut is known as **hyperactive agency
detection** (HAAD):4^ the tendency to believe events were caused by an
intentional force, even without evidence. We'll dig deeper into HAAD in
the bias section.

Patternicity and HAAD often work together. We don't just spot
patterns---we assume someone made them. A layoff feels like a "sign." A
missed flight is "meant to be." A lucky break? "Fate." As soon as
something feels emotionally charged, the Old Brain kicks in and assigns
intent.

But we rarely pause to question that shift. The New Brain *should*
engage, but we often stay in automatic. And when facts are missing, the
Old Brain fills the gaps with a story.

As noted in Chapter 4, the Old Brain hates uncertainty. So when
clarity's lacking, it spins a narrative---whether it's superstition,
conspiracy, or a powerful marketing message. These stories give chaos
shape and create a false sense of control.

Together, Patternicity and HAAD act like a meaning-making machine. They
help the world feel coherent and predictable, but often at the expense
of truth.

Magicians, con artists, and, unfortunately, some politicians exploit
this glitch. With misdirection, they bypass the New Brain and hijack the
Old. These aren't just tricks---they're lessons in how easily perception
can be gamed.

Optical illusions deliver the same warning: our brains leap to
conclusions and resist changing course---even when the gears clearly
need shifting.

## Why We Struggle with Math and Probabilities

Understanding mathematics and probability is essential for making sense
of the world around us. But here's the catch: doing so requires
significant effort from the New Brain. While the Old Brain is brilliant
at quickly and intuitively recognizing patterns, it struggles with the
abstract, symbolic, and often counterintuitive nature of numbers and
statistics. Concepts like probability, ratios, risk, and statistical
reasoning don't come naturally---they demand slow, deliberate,
step-by-step thinking. That means shifting into manual transmission and
relying on the smaller, more analytical gear.

In many ways, one of the biggest cognitive challenges of modern life is
the constant tug-of-war between the Old Brain's instinctive
pattern-seeking and the New Brain's need for cold, methodical precision.
This friction affects how we interpret everything from polling data and
financial projections to medical trials and weather forecasts.

Consider the common phrase, *"There are no coincidences."* It's a
reassuring thought---but not a statistically sound one. We encounter,
hear, see, dream about, remember and think of thousands of things every
day. Occasionally, two of those things will align purely by chance.
Probability theory---and what statisticians call the **Law of Truly
Large Numbers**5^---tells us that in a large enough sample, surprising
things aren't rare. They're inevitable. But the Old Brain doesn't
like randomness. As we saw in Chapter 4, it **craves resolution**. So it
floors the gas in automatic mode and leaps to meaning: *"It's a sign."*
*"This happened for a reason."*

It feels accurate. **But that doesn't make it true.**

**Think before answering:** How many people need to be in a room before
two of them likely share the same birthday?

Despite the 365 possible birthdays, it only takes 23 people for the odds
to surpass 50%. The odds increase to 97% with 50 people---a
counterintuitive probability result known as the Birthday Paradox.

That's the tricky part about probability theory---it doesn't just
confuse the Old Brain; it challenges the New Brain too. Truly
understanding it takes effort, training, and a grasp of math most of us
never learn. So we do what humans have always done: **we fill in the
gaps.**

But that's also where the opportunity lies. The key is knowing when to
shift gears. When the Old Brain leaps to conclusions, it's our job to
engage the clutch, ease off the automatic response, and let the New
Brain take control. That's how we move from gut reaction to genuine
insight.

**Stuck in the Wrong Gear: The Gambler's Fallacy**

Few examples illustrate the clash between instinct and reason more
vividly than gambling. Why are we so drawn to it? Because the Old
Brain---driven by pattern-seeking and reward anticipation---convinces us
that a win is just around the corner.

Lose five hands of blackjack in a row, and it *feels* like the odds are
now in your favour. That's the **gambler's fallacy in action**---the
belief that past losses somehow increase the chances of an upcoming win.
It's a mental glitch: each hand, each coin flip, is an independent
event. The cards don't know you've been losing. The roulette wheel has
no memory. But your Old Brain doesn't care. It sees a pattern and
assumes it must mean something.

This is **patternicity at work**---our tendency to see trends where none
exist. It's a feature of the Old Brain's design: useful in nature,
misleading at the casino.

As we now know, correcting this flawed thinking requires effort---it
means consciously shifting into manual transmission and letting the New
Brain take the wheel. But for many, especially those with **addictive
tendencies,** that shift doesn't come easily. The Old Brain, revved up
by emotion and the thrill of the moment, overrides logic before the
clutch is even touched.

Some have lost fortunes---sometimes even their life savings---not
because they lacked intelligence, but because they misunderstood one
essential truth:

**Probability doesn't keep a scoreboard.**

## New Brain Confabulation

We've already seen how inference and patternicity operate as part of the
Old Brain's rapid-response system---automatically filling in gaps and
forming conclusions on the fly to keep us safe. But what happens next?
That's when the New Brain steps in to do damage control. It fabricates a
clean, coherent explanation for decisions that were actually made in the
moment---often to protect our self-image or soothe internal discomfort.
This behaviour has a name: confabulation.6^

Confabulation is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology and
neuroscience, particularly in memory research. It describes how the
brain unintentionally creates false memories or rationales, not out of
deception, but to make sense of incomplete or conflicting information.

Think of confabulation as **special pleading turned inward**. Whereas
special pleading (covered in Chapter 5) tries to defend our position in
public debate, confabulation defends our self-perception. It drafts
missing facts, motives, and memories so seamlessly that we rarely
question the narrative. The New Brain doesn't lie maliciously---it
invents stories that feel real in order to **preserve coherence**.

This tendency becomes especially clear in courtrooms. Eyewitnesses often
testify with absolute confidence---even when they're objectively wrong.
They aren't lying; they're confabulating. Their New Brain has
unknowingly "filled in the blanks" with details that didn't actually
happen. That's why skilled attorneys, especially during
cross-examination, learn to spot these gaps. They know that confident
memories can still be creative fictions.

## Confabulation in Marketing and Branding

Confabulation isn't just a psychological curiosity---it plays a starring
role in how we interact with brands and make buying decisions. Marketers
know this, even if they don't always call it by name.

Imagine someone purchasing a \$1,500 designer handbag. If asked why,
they might say, *"It's great quality,"* or *"It'll last forever."* But
the truth---the **emotional truth**---might be that it made them feel
confident, admired, or part of a particular social group. The logic
comes after. The New Brain builds a story that fits the facts, even if
it's not the full picture.

Brand loyalty often relies on confabulation, too.

*[Example:]* Ask an Apple fan why they love the brand, and
you'll hear things like "It just works." But beneath that are deeper
drivers---creativity, status, belonging. Apple leads with emotion and
identity; the New Brain fills in the logic later.

This is why storytelling, which we'll cover in Chapter 11, matters in
branding. A compelling brand narrative gives the Old Brain something to
latch onto emotionally, while giving the New Brain material to justify
the decision later. Strong brands make us feel something first, then let
us rationalize the purchase in a way that preserves our sense of being
thoughtful, savvy consumers.

And here's the twist: even when we know this is happening, we're not
immune. That's the beauty---and the trap---of confabulation. It works
quietly, behind the scenes, giving us not just products we like but
reasons to like them.

## Cognitive Biases

We've seen how the Old Brain excels at rapid reconnaissance---drawing
swift inferences, spotting patterns through patternicity, and even
rewriting memories via confabulation to maintain a coherent story with
the New Brain's help. These aren't flaws---they're features.

But what happens when these shortcuts become ingrained? That's when they
solidify into **cognitive biases.**

Cognitive biases are the Old Brain's habitual shortcuts---**deep mental
grooves formed through repetition.** They're predictable, systematic
distortions that unconsciously shape how we perceive, judge, and decide.
They aren't signs of irrationality---they're the cost of a brain
optimized for speed over accuracy.

When the Old Brain's gear spins too fast---cranking out snap
judgments---it can overpower the more effortful gear of the New Brain.
Without consciously pressing the clutch and shifting into manual, we
stay in automatic mode, **coasting on reflex.**

The issue isn't having biases---we all do. The real danger lies in
**failing to recognize when we're in auto mode**, letting instinct drive
while reason idles in neutral.

The good news? By learning to spot these blind spots---the Old Brain's
favourite shortcuts---we strengthen our ability to shift gears. We train
ourselves to engage the New Brain when it counts.

Let's now explore some of the most common ways our Old Brain can steer
us wrong.

## Confirmation Bias

This is one of the most studied and well-known biases, yet it often
operates quietly in the background. It's the bias that lets us deceive
ourselves. **Confirmation bias** causes us to view the world through a
lens that amplifies what we want to see and filters out what we'd rather
ignore. When encountering new information, we tend to favour evidence
that supports our existing views and dismiss or rationalize anything
that contradicts them.

This selective focus reinforces our beliefs, making them harder to
shake. The more we seek out agreeable information, the deeper the mental
grooves become---nudging our judgments along familiar, comfortable paths
while resisting alternate perspectives.

In politics, confirmation bias shapes and shields our views. We're drawn
to sources that echo our opinions, collecting supportive data and tuning
out dissent. Over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to question
our own stance or admit we could be wrong.

From a marketing standpoint, confirmation bias isn't just
psychological---it's a business model. News networks like Fox News, CNN,
and MSNBC---regardless of politics---have built empires by reinforcing
their viewers' beliefs. These channels air roughly 20 minutes of
commercials per hour, priced according to viewership. They've added
subscription revenue too. So, the stronger the audience's loyalty, the
higher the profits. That creates a strong incentive to feed either left-
or right-leaning echo chambers---cognitive comfort zones that boost
ratings.

We're now seeing similar trends in Canadian media. And the effect
multiplies with social media influencers and podcasts, which attract
millions of like-minded followers and serve up a steady diet of
reinforcement.

*[Example:]* As of 2025, Joe Rogan stands as one of the most
influential and highest-earning media personalities globally. His annual
earnings are estimated to be about **\$140 million**, derived from
multiple revenue streams, including a Spotify deal, podcast sponsorships
and YouTube earnings. Confirmation bias pays handsomely.

Unfortunately, news platforms and influencers that attempt to present a
more "balanced" perspective often struggle to attract viewership. This
represents the **toxic influence** of confirmation bias: it actively
punishes those who seek to promote diverse opinions.

## Anchoring Bias

**Anchoring bias** often shapes our decisions without us realizing it.
Rooted in the Old Brain's need for context (as discussed in Chapter 3),
this bias causes us to fixate on the first piece of information we
receive---whether it's a number, a price, or a fact---and use it as a
benchmark for all subsequent judgments.

That initial anchor subtly influences how we interpret everything that
follows, regardless of its accuracy or relevance. Even when we try to
adjust our thinking, we often remain tethered to that first impression.
It shapes our reasoning in ways that seem rational but are actually
driven by that starting point.

To make more objective decisions, we must engage the New Brain to spot
and challenge the anchor---otherwise, our thinking stays stuck in
automatic.

*[Example:]* Steve Jobs was famously skilled at using price
anchoring---a powerful cognitive bias. During Apple's January 2010 event
introducing the iPad, Jobs strategically anchored consumer expectations
by first suggesting a higher price. When he initially revealed the
analyst-predicted price of \$999, he set audience expectations
accordingly. Moments later, when Jobs announced the actual starting
price at \$499, the iPad instantly seemed like a remarkable bargain,
triggering enthusiastic reactions.

## Decoy Effect

The **decoy effect** occurs when a less appealing option is deliberately
introduced to steer people toward a specific "target" choice. Though
each option may seem independent, the presence of the decoy shifts our
perception. The Old Brain struggles to evaluate things in absolute
terms, so it relies on comparison shortcuts.

When presented with two choices, we might hesitate. But introduce a
third, clearly inferior option, and suddenly one of the originals looks
far better.

This tactic is common in pricing strategies. The decoy isn't meant to be
chosen---it's there to guide us through contrast. It sets a benchmark
that makes the favoured option seem like the best deal. This subtle
influence works below the level of awareness, playing on our tendency to
judge value relatively. With the decoy in place, our New Brain is nudged
toward a decision that feels logical---even though it was carefully
designed by a savvy choice architect.

*[Example:]* A restaurant offers three drink sizes: small
for \$3, medium for \$5, and large for \$5.50. People tend to choose the
large because it seems like a better value compared to the medium.

## Commitment Bias

Commitment bias occurs when adhering to a past decision is prioritized
over reevaluating it in light of new circumstances. Once we've publicly
stated our position or invested considerable time and resources into a
course of action, a desire for consistency drives us to stick with that
choice. Despite any overriding doubts or new insights, we find ourselves
rationalizing the status quo to avoid the discomfort of acknowledging a
mistake or appearing unreliable. This tendency can turn initial minor
commitments into long-term obligations, restricting our agility and
adaptability.

*[Example:]* Continue using an old subscription service
because you've already invested time in it.

## Sunk Cost Bias

Sunk cost bias occurs when past investments---time, money, or
effort---keep us stuck on an unproductive path. Instead of assessing a
situation on its current value, we fixate on what we've already "paid"
and hope to recover it by pushing forward.

This often leads us to stick with failing projects, bad relationships,
or outdated habits just to avoid admitting a loss. But those costs are
gone. Recognizing that allows us to make better decisions---grounded in
present value, not past expense.

*[Example:]* Finishing a lousy movie because you've already
watched an hour. Or staying in line after committing time to it.

## Scarcity Bias

Scarcity bias taps into our instinctive reaction to dwindling
opportunities. When something seems limited or hard to get, we assign it
greater value and rush to secure it. This response evolved to help us
survive in environments where missing out on rare resources could be
costly.

Today, that same impulse is triggered by cues like "only 2 left" or
"limited time offer." While scarcity can signal true value, it's often
used to bypass reflection and prompt fast, emotional decisions.

**FOMO: The Old Brain's Alarm Bell**

Scarcity bias fuels FOMO---Fear of Missing Out. Long before social
media, this instinct helped us avoid being excluded or losing access to
essential resources. Now, it kicks in when we see exclusive deals, flash
sales, or friends posting experiences we're not part of. Brands exploit
this with countdowns, limited stock, and social proof---all designed to
trigger Old Brain urgency and short-circuit the New Brain's logic.

*[Example:]* During Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in Toronto
(November 2024), ticket resale prices skyrocketed due to overwhelming
demand and limited availability. While face-value tickets were
originally priced between \$100 and \$500 CAD, the secondary market
experienced a dramatic surge. Standard upper-level seats were reselling
for approximately \$1,400 to \$2,600 CAD, and premium floor seats
reached as high as \$20,000 CAD on platforms like StubHub and
VividSeats. This significant price increase occurred worldwide,
exemplifying the powerful interplay of FOMO and scarcity bias. The
spectacle became self-reinforcing---each person who posted their success
amplified the panic for others, pushing many to buy impulsively just to
avoid the emotional sting of missing out. This is the Old Brain in
action: evolutionarily wired to secure scarce resources fast before the
tribe beats you to it.

## Social Proof Bias

Social proof, or in-group bias, takes advantage of our tendency to look
to others for cues on how to behave or think, particularly when we're
unsure. By observing the actions, beliefs, and preferences of those
around us, we feel more confident making similar choices. This instinct
is rooted in our inherently social nature, where group consensus often
acted as a reliable indicator of what was safe, acceptable, or
advantageous. Nowadays, it can be seen in following trends or favouring
widely praised products simply because collective endorsement offers a
trusted guide through a complex and uncertain world.

*[Example:]* Choosing a crowded restaurant over an empty
one.

## MySide Bias

Author meeting Steve Pinker in Toronto 2019

One of my go-to thinkers is Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, whom I
had the pleasure of meeting at a conference. In his book *Rationality:
What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters* (2021), Pinker explores
**MySide bias**7^---a powerful cognitive shortcut that warps how we
interpret the world, especially in social and political settings.

Closely related to social proof and in-group bias, MySide bias is our
reflex to support "our side" and discount opposing viewpoints. You see
it in sports all the time: fans rage about every questionable call
against their team, while ignoring or excusing the same fouls committed
by their own. If you've ever watched your kid's hockey game from the
stands, you know just how one-sided it can feel.

This bias speaks to the Old Brain's tribal wiring. Loyalty to our group
feels right, and the "other side" must be wrong. What starts as
cheerleading can harden into ideological rigidity---where each group
claims moral high ground and sees the other as not just wrong, but
dangerous. Everyone thinks they're defending "truth," but those truths
rarely overlap---making compromise or shared understanding feel
impossible.

*[Example:]* Nowhere is this more evident than in modern
politics. Instead of consistently championing well-defined ideologies,
many parties will pivot, backtrack, or adopt an entirely new stance---so
long as it helps them attack the opposition. Every side claims to have a
monopoly on "the truth," but they're so entrenched in MySide bias that
genuine dialogue often collapses under the weight of partisanship.

## Authority Bias

Authority bias derives its strength from the deep-seated habit of
deferring to those considered knowledgeable or in a position of
authority, such as an expert or law officer. Throughout history, heeding
the advice of leaders or elders has often enhanced our chances of
survival. Even today, we tend to place greater trust in statements made
by individuals with titles, credentials, or prestige, sometimes
bypassing our own critical judgment. This deference can facilitate
decision making in unfamiliar areas, but it also makes us susceptible to
persuasion by those who wield authority as a tool, regardless of whether
their guidance truly deserves our confidence and trust.

*[Example:]* Trusting a celebrity endorsement without
further research.

## Loss Aversion Bias

Loss aversion bias highlights how the pain of losing often outweighs the
pleasure of gaining an equivalent benefit. This imbalance arises from an
innate survival instinct: resources lost cannot be easily replaced,
while new gains are simply potential advantages. Consequently, we
respond more strongly to threats of loss than to promises of reward.
This distorted emotional response can skew decision-making, leading us
to cling more tightly to what we have and to avoid risks that could
yield significant gains. Acknowledging this bias helps us balance our
perceptions, allowing logic to coexist with our instinctual aversion to
loss.

*[Example:]* Holding onto a declining stock because selling
feels like accepting a loss.

## Halo Effect Bias

The halo effect is a cognitive bias whereby our overall impression of a
person, company, brand, or product influences our judgments about their
specific traits. This bias often leads us to assume that if someone or
something excels in one area, they must also excel in others. For
instance, we might perceive physically attractive individuals as more
intelligent or trustworthy, even in the absence of evidence supporting
these assumptions. Understanding the halo effect is crucial, as it
reminds us to evaluate individuals based on objective criteria rather
than allowing superficial attributes to cloud our judgment.

*[Example:]* In a hiring scenario, a recruiter might favour
a well-dressed, attractive candidate, assuming they are more competent,
despite other applicants having stronger qualifications.

## Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias, often called the "I-knew-it-all-along" phenomenon, is
the tendency to view past events as having been more predictable than
they actually were. After an event has occurred, individuals frequently
believe they could have anticipated the outcome, even if there was
little basis for predicting it beforehand. This bias can lead to
overconfidence in one's judgment and can distort memory, making it
difficult to learn from past experiences accurately. Understanding
hindsight bias is vital, as it emphasizes the importance of objectively
analyzing past events without allowing current knowledge to cloud our
judgment.

*[Example:]* After a company unexpectedly goes bankrupt, an
investor claims they "knew it was going to fail" despite having
previously expressed confidence in its success.

## Hyperactive Agency Detection (HAAD)

HAAD, which we discussed earlier, is a cognitive bias rooted in
patternicity---our tendency to assume that intentional agents are behind
events, even without evidence. It's the Old Brain's radar for spotting
agency, and it's always on high alert. Psychologists call it
*hyperactive* because it leaps to conclusions without waiting for proof,
erring on the side of caution.

From an evolutionary perspective, this made sense. It was safer to
mistake a rustling bush for a predator than risk ignoring a real threat.
Over generations, the brain began to favour false positives when agency
might be present, especially in uncertain or high-stakes situations.

Today, that same reflex often misfires. Instead of predators, we see
hidden motives, divine signs, or cosmic messages. A bad driver feels
like a personal attack. A lost job offer seems like fate. The Old Brain
hates randomness, so it invents stories---filling in gaps with imagined
intent.

*[Example]*: You're alone in your house at night and hear a
floorboard creak. Your brain doesn't assume the wood is settling. It
imagines someone walking. In that moment, you're not just hearing a
sound---you're detecting a potential agent. That's HAAD in action. It's
trying to protect you, even if there's nothing there.

## Amazon is a Master of Bias Marketing

Understanding biases is crucial for effective marketing and sales
strategies. Innovative businesses capitalize on these biases to persuade
customers to make purchases in a compelling manner. Few companies do
this as effectively as Amazon, often right before your eyes, even if you
don't consciously notice it.

A typical Amazon product page expertly leverages several cognitive
biases:

**- Star Rating:** Taps into Confirmation Bias, reinforcing your
existing beliefs about the product\'s quality.

**- "Amazon\'s Choice\" Banner:** Utilizes Authority Bias, suggesting
that trusted sources endorse the product.

**- Number 1 Best Seller Flag:** Employs Social Proof Bias, indicating
that many others prefer this product, which boosts your confidence in
your choice.

**- Price Reduction:** Engages Anchoring Bias, making you perceive the
current price as a great deal compared to the original.

**- Only 2 Left in Stock:** Exploits Scarcity Bias, creating urgency
that compels you to make a quicker decision.

**- Customer Images:** Influences Halo Effect Bias, as seeing
beautiful landscape images makes using the product more relatable and
trustworthy.

**- Customers Also Bought:** This appeals to MySide or In-Group Bias,
suggesting that buying this product will align you with those who
share your preferences.

With this newfound awareness, you'll never view an Amazon product page
the same way again!

**Quick Diagnostic: Are You About to Commit a Bias?**

1\. Am I emotionally attached to a preferred outcome? (Confirmation)

2\. Did I anchor on the first number I saw? (Anchoring)

3\. Would I still choose this if the offer were to disappear today?
(Scarcity)

Keep the card on your desk; your New Brain will thank you.

## Logical Fallacies

After exploring Cognitive Biases---those intuitive shortcuts driven by
the Old Brain---we now shift focus.

Logical fallacies are a different kind of misfire. These aren't just
errors in instinct---they're **breakdowns in reasoning itself.** A
fallacy may sound logical at first, but collapses under closer
inspection.

Unlike biases, which operate mostly beneath awareness, fallacies often
arise in the New Brain's domain. They show up when it rushes to justify
an Old Brain impulse, defend a belief, or win an argument. Sometimes
it's unconscious---the smaller gear struggling to keep up with the big
one. Other times, fallacies are used deliberately, as persuasive tools
that rely on flawed logic.

Either way, they signal the **mental transmission slipping out of
sync.**

Learning to spot fallacies is like feeling when your cognitive clutch
isn't fully engaged. It lets you downshift into clarity, slow down, and
assess whether the reasoning truly holds up.

Let's explore the most common types---so you can recognize them in real
time and shift out of faulty logic before it takes you somewhere you
don't want to go.

## False Cause Fallacy

Also known as *post hoc* reasoning, the false cause fallacy occurs when
we assume one event caused another simply because they happened around
the same time. This instinct often stems from the Old Brain's tendency
to spot patterns and jump to conclusions.

This is where the New Brain must shift into manual mode and ask: *"Could
something else be at play?"* That one question can open the door to
deeper reasoning, helping us avoid oversimplifying and arrive at a more
accurate understanding of cause and effect.

*[Example:]* Imagine someone notices that ice cream sales
and violent crime rates increase during the summer months. Jumping to
the conclusion that eating ice cream causes violent crime is a classic
false-cause mistake. The real factor might be the warmer weather, which
encourages more people to be outside, leading to increased ice cream
purchases and more opportunities for conflict.

## Fundamental Attribution Error

The **fundamental attribution error** occurs when we blame external
circumstances for our own questionable actions, yet attribute others'
missteps to their character. This reflex is driven by the Old Brain's
need to preserve our self-image.

When we make mistakes, the "thin-skinned" Old Brain quickly signals the
New Brain to rationalize---to protect how we see ourselves and how we're
seen by others. Admitting fault risks shaking our sense of competence
and our social standing, both of which are deeply tied to survival
instincts.

At the first sign of personal blame, the Old Brain's gear spins faster,
while the New Brain struggles to engage the clutch, slowing things down
with honesty, logic, and introspection.

*[Example:]* If another driver cuts you off, you might yell
*"Asshole!"* at them and happily give them the finger. But if you
accidentally cut someone off because you were momentarily distracted,
you don't see yourself as a terrible person---it's just an innocent
mistake.

## Red Herring Fallacy

A Red Herring strategically introduces irrelevant details that distract
from the core issue we are trying to tackle. Imagine your Old Brain
yelling, "Look over here!" just as your New Brain tries to concentrate
on the real problem. This diversion can create confusion, making it
challenging to address what truly matters. Instead of clarity, we become
entangled in a web of distractions that can lead to misdirected efforts
and wasted time. Recognizing a Red Herring is crucial; it enables us to
refocus our attention on the pressing issues that require our immediate
action and thoughtful consideration.

*[Example:]* Ask a politician about environmental policies,
and they pivot to talking about job creation. The shift in topic is
deliberate--- an attempt to divert attention from the actual question.

## Bandwagon Fallacy

This fallacy cleverly takes advantage of our Old Brain's deep-seated
urge for belonging and group acceptance to fit in---after all, if
everyone else is doing it, it must be right...right? It makes us
especially vulnerable to following the crowd, even when it might not
serve our best interests. Recognizing this tendency can help us make
better decisions guided by genuine needs instead of group pressure.

*[Example:]* "Everyone is investing in cryptocurrency, so it
must be a good idea," or a politician saying, "Everyone agrees with my
plan."

## Straw Man Fallacy

The Straw Man approach is a rhetorical tactic that distorts or
oversimplifies another person's argument, making it significantly easier
to dismantle or refute. This method often involves misrepresenting the
opposing viewpoint, which allows the user to attack a weakened or
exaggerated version of that argument rather than addressing the actual
position.

*[Example:]* "You say we should have less homework, so you
must want students to learn nothing!" It twists a moderate suggestion
into an extreme position that's simple to attack.

## Slippery Slope Fallacy

The Slippery Slope argument suggests that a seemingly minor change can
trigger a domino effect, ultimately resulting in severe and often
disastrous consequences. This concept preys upon the Old Brain's
inherent fear of the unknown, bypassing rational reasoning and jumping
to extreme conclusions.

*[Example:]* "If we allow students to use calculators, soon
they won't know how to do basic math."

## Appeal to Emotion Fallacy

This tactic targets our feelings directly rather than providing solid
evidence. It leverages the Old Brain's emotional pull while ignoring the
New Brain's need for data or reason.

*[Example:]* "Think of the children!" as a way to shut down
any counterargument without addressing the facts.

## False Dilemma Fallacy

Also known as the "either/or" fallacy, it corners you into picking
between two options, even though more choices might exist. It's a neat
trick that exploits our instinct to make quick judgments.

*[Example:]* "You're either with us or against us." In
reality, there are often many ways to support---or disagree---without
taking an extreme stance.

## Guilt by Association Fallacy

The guilt by association fallacy crops up when we accept or dismiss an
idea because of **who is linked to it** rather than **what the idea
actually says**. Our Old Brain's hard‑wired tribal radar scans for
friend‑or‑foe signals; if a proposal or person even *smells* connected
to a distrusted group, the reflex is to shove them outside the campfire
ring---no questions asked.

But the New Brain's job is to pause and probe: *"Is the claim itself
sound, regardless of its source?"* By separating people from
propositions, we prevent rash judgments that can starve us of good
information or steer us into bad decisions.

***[Example:]*** A start‑up pitches a recycling technology
at a municipal forum. When council members learn the founder once
interned at a petroleum company, they reject the plan outright---"Big
Oil fingerprints all over this!" Yet the tech's carbon footprint data
were independently audited and beat every alternative on the table. The
council's snap decision protected their image but torpedoed a solution
that actually advanced their sustainability goals.

Recognizing that the New Brain often deploys logical fallacies to
justify decisions already made by the Old Brain helps us think more
critically and communicate more ethically. These aren't just slips in
logic---they're usually attempts to rationalize gut-level choices after
the fact. By spotting this pattern, we can shift into manual mode, slow
down our reasoning, and challenge flawed arguments---both our own and
others'. This awareness also sharpens our branding and messaging,
letting us craft compelling narratives without relying on manipulation
or faulty logic.

## Cognitive Dissonance

You've likely felt that uncomfortable mental tension when your actions
don't quite match your values. That's cognitive dissonance---your mind's
alarm system for internal conflict. It kicks in when the **Old Brain
makes a fast, emotional decision**, and the **New Brain struggles to
justify it**.

It's like our two brain gears suddenly **grind against each other**,
creating psychological friction. The Old Brain, which craves harmony and
quick resolution, can't tolerate this misalignment for long. To get the
mental machine running smoothly again, we instinctively seek ways to
reduce tension.

Sometimes, we compartmentalize our beliefs, tucking conflicting ideas
into separate corners of the mind so they don't clash. However, when
conflict becomes unavoidable, we face a choice: either update our
beliefs or attempt to explain them away.

In theory, the healthiest solution would be to revise one or both
conflicting ideas. But that's hard work. So, more often, we **slip back
into automatic mode**, and the **New Brain shifts into rationalization
gear**. It starts telling a story that makes our actions make
sense---even if that story is built on shaky logic. This is **special
pleading** in action: bending reason to fit the narrative we want to
believe.

Cognitive dissonance shows just how tightly the Old and New Brain are
linked---and how often the New Brain's role is less about reasoning and
more about repairing the emotional aftermath of a snap decision.

**Signs of Cognitive Dissonance:**

- Feeling uneasy before making a decision, as the smaller gear tries
to resist the momentum set by the larger gear.

- Justifying or rationalizing actions after the fact, with the smaller
gear turning to provide a narrative that fits the Old Brain's
instinctive choice.

- Experiencing guilt or regret when the smaller gear recognizes a
mismatch between action and belief.

- Feeling like a victim, the smaller gear struggles to resolve
inconsistencies in a way that preserves the Old Brain\'s positive
self-image.

- Conforming to social pressures even when they conflict with personal
beliefs, as the large gear pushes for acceptance and safety, while the
smaller gear tries to justify the compromise.

Understanding cognitive dissonance can be advantageous in marketing and
business. Introducing new ideas and concepts that resonate with the Old
Brain can alleviate dissonance, prompting a subconscious appreciation
for the efforts made.

## Victimhood Reconsidered

As we've explored, cognitive dissonance arises when an individual's
actions contradict their self-perception. For example, someone who sees
themselves as "good" may feel mental tension if their behaviour suggests
otherwise. To ease this discomfort, the New Brain often alters the
narrative, portraying the individual as a **victim of circumstance** or
the actions of others. This helps preserve the Old Brain's positive
self-image.

In this moment, the **larger gear** keeps spinning, reinforcing the
belief, "I am good," while the **smaller gear** engages in
rationalization---working to justify behaviours that contradict that
self-concept. **Unless we deliberately shift into manual mode**, the New
Brain often goes along for the ride, supporting the Old Brain's
preferred storyline.

Unfortunately, many people default to victimhood as a coping mechanism.
It allows them to reduce internal conflict without confronting
uncomfortable truths. But if your product or service empowers
individuals to **consciously shift gears**, accept accountability, and
plan for change, it can strengthen the New Brain's ability to develop
healthier strategies going forward.

Encouraging people to take ownership of their actions---and to envision
their desired future state---can be a powerful branding strategy. It
aligns your message with personal growth, resilience, and
transformation. That's why so many motivational speakers and authors
have built careers around this very insight.

## Why All This Matters in Branding

Understanding the errors in thinking reviewed above isn't just
interesting trivia---it's essential for connecting with your audience on
a deeper level.

**- Build Trust:** By avoiding logical fallacies and recognizing
mental shortcuts, your messaging remains credible, giving the New
Brain fewer reasons to stall out.

**- Influence Decisions:** Leveraging cognitive biases ethically helps
engage the Old Brain first, then smoothly shift into New Brain
validation, guiding your audience toward choices they can feel *and*
justify.

**- Enhance Engagement:** Addressing moments of cognitive dissonance
gives customers the chance to pause, reflect, and shift into manual
mode, deepening emotional connection and brand loyalty.

## Wrapping It Up

By now, you've seen how easily the Old Brain can lead us astray---with a
little help from the New Brain. Inference, patternicity, confabulation,
and other shortcuts aren't flaws---they're built-in features of a system
wired for speed and survival. However, in today's complex world, where
nuance and constant information overload prevail, those same shortcuts
can lead to flawed judgments, unconscious bias, and misplaced
confidence.

Understanding these thinking errors isn't just academic---it's
practical. It's the difference between coasting in automatic and
consciously shifting into manual when the road ahead demands more
precision. By recognizing the invisible forces behind our snap judgments
and emotional reactions, you can communicate more effectively, lead more
thoughtfully, and make decisions with greater clarity. Whether you're
crafting a brand message, pitching a new idea, or simply navigating
everyday choices, this awareness becomes a potent competitive edge.

As an added bonus of this book, I want to help you personally overcome
and regain control over some of our inherent errors in thinking. In the
next chapter, I will introduce you to **Critical Thinking** and how it
can genuinely improve your life. When you learn to ease off the gas,
press the clutch, and engage that smaller gear with intention, you
become a more skilled driver of your own decisions.

Before we move on, use the "Errors in Thinking Table" on the next page
as a quick-reference guide---a mental checklist you can revisit any time
the gears feel out of sync and you need to slow things down,
double-check your assumptions, and steer with purpose.

This is your toolkit for spotting when the Old Brain is jumping
ahead---and giving the New Brain a fighting chance to weigh in, which we
cover next.

# **Chapter 7: Bonus chapter: Critical Thinking**

**"The First principle is that you must not fool yourself---and you
are the easiest person to fool."**

Richard Feynman, physicist

In a world of AI-generated fakes, conspiracy memes, and dopamine-driven
headlines, your brain's autopilot is no longer enough. It's time to
**take the wheel.**

We've just finished dismantling the mental potholes---biases,
heuristics, and fallacies---that knock the Old Brain off course. Now we
shift from analysis to action. Critical thinking means deliberately
putting your New Brain in manual mode---overriding the Old Brain's
automatic responses with the conscious habit of pausing, probing, and
double-checking before you decide, buy, post, or lead.

**My confession:** If I'd learned this discipline earlier, I might've
avoided an ill-fated partnership, an over-leveraged radio station, and a
costly boat I convinced myself was "an investment." Each misstep began
with an Old-Brain rush---excitement, urgency, tribal pressure---followed
by New Brain rationalizations trying to explain it all away. Only later
did I realize the cost of acting first and analyzing later.

That hindsight is what prompted this "bonus" chapter. Critical thinking
isn't just academic---it's the hidden reward of mastering the Divided
Brain model. Once you grasp how the gears interact, you can feel when
it's time to clutch in, slow the spin, and shift into conscious control.

A decade ago, you could spot a fake photo by a weird shadow or
off-kilter pixel. Now, a text prompt can conjure a 4K video of the Pope
skateboarding---before your coffee cools. Audio deepfakes can clone your
voice and call your mother. These synthetic creations slide past the Old
Brain's "looks real, must be real" shortcut, lighting up our pattern
circuits before the New Brain even knows what hit it.

That's why critical thinking isn't optional anymore.

## What is Critical Thinking

We've seen how much of our understanding and beliefs about the world are
shaped by a carefully curated narrative---filtered, interpreted, and
reshaped by the Old Brain's love of inference, patternicity, and its
drive for simplicity and comfort. Add the New Brain's tendency to
confabulate---to rationalize rather than challenge---and it's no wonder
we often fall into systematic thinking traps.

Acknowledging this brutal truth separates critical thinkers from passive
passengers in their own mental vehicle. Once we accept that our memories
are sketchy and our perceptions are likely flawed, we become more
cautious about accepting our conclusions at face value.

**Humility is the gateway to critical thinking. It gives us the
cognitive strength to manually shift mental gears and force the New
Brain to engage in metacognition.**

It means resisting the urge to accept what feels right and instead
asking, "Is it actually right?"

Even for those who consider themselves seasoned critical thinkers, the
challenge remains. We like to believe we're rational beings---but that's
the mind's greatest sleight of hand. The moment you feel you're immune
to bias is when you've **stopped thinking critically**. **The gears have
seized into default Old Brain mode.**

Let's review what happens when the gears seize.

## Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: The Need to Believe

When the New Brain struggles to find clear, evidence-based answers, the
Old Brain steps in---eager to resolve uncertainty with speed and
simplicity. As we saw in the chapter on Errors in Thinking, two key
shortcuts often drive this: *Patternicity*---our tendency to see
meaningful patterns in meaningless noise---and *Hyperactive Agency
Detection* (HAAD)---our reflex to assume intentional beings are behind
random events. These instincts evolved to help us survive, but they can
easily mislead us in today's complex world.

Faced with ambiguity, the Old Brain doesn't wait for data---**it fills
in the blanks with stories**. It detects patterns where none exist and
invents unseen agents to explain what it can't immediately grasp. This
intuitive leap feels good. It brings a surge of certainty, control, and
emotional closure---especially in moments of anxiety, grief, or
existential doubt. That's why pseudoscience and paranormal beliefs
thrive: not from a lack of information, but in the spaces where science
hasn't yet reached.

Pseudoscience refers to beliefs or practices falsely presented as
scientific. Unlike actual science, rooted in empirical evidence,
replicability, and peer review, pseudoscience leans on anecdotes, vague
claims, selective data, and unfalsifiable ideas. It often borrows the
language of science, but lacks its discipline. Common examples include:

- Astrology

- Psychic phenomena and ESP

- Alternative healing methods

- Cryptozoology

- Ancient astronaut theories

- Flat Earth beliefs

- Numerology

Closely related is the **phenomenon of paranormal events** that fall
outside the known laws of nature and science. While pseudoscience often
pretends to be scientific, paranormal claims usually bypass science
altogether, appealing directly to belief in the supernatural. Common
examples include:

- Ghosts and hauntings

- Telekinesis (moving objects with the mind)

- Near-death experiences (claims of visiting the afterlife)

- UFOs as extraterrestrial spacecraft

- Cryptids (Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster)

Both pseudoscience and the paranormal offer comforting explanations and
compelling narratives, primarily when genuine science doesn't yet
provide answers. They speak not to our New Brain, but to our instinctive
Old Brain's need for closure and meaning. Fueled by Patternicity and
HAAD, they deliver the **illusion of understanding** by making us feel
like someone (or something) is in control of the chaos.

## Belief vs. Skepticism

Beliefs thrive in the comfort of the Old Brain. They embed deeply,
becoming default mindsets---even in the face of contradictory evidence.
People don't consciously choose to ignore facts; instead, the Old Brain
prioritizes loyalty, identity, and emotional safety, often overriding
the New Brain's pursuit of clarity.

Belief can act as a firewall, shielding the Old Brain from disruptive
ideas. It offers comfort and consistency, but that same comfort can
dampen curiosity and limit our willingness to question. When belief
becomes rigid or defensive, it leaves little room for the New Brain to
weigh the evidence and reconsider.

This isn't a criticism of belief itself, but a recognition of how
strongly it's rooted in our evolutionary wiring---and why the Old Brain
is **resistant to change**, as we discovered in Chapter 4. Fortunately,
as you've seen throughout this book, the New Brain can override that
inertia when activated with conscious effort and skepticism through
metacognition.

Let's clarify what skepticism means. It's not cynicism or
closed-mindedness. It's a mindset that holds claims to a consistent
standard and stays open to change when credible new evidence emerges.
**It's how we give the New Brain space to think, test, and
verify**---rather than letting the Old Brain steer on instinct alone.

The skeptic performs a simple but powerful act: asking "Where's the
evidence?"---fostering curiosity while protecting against deception and
bias. As professional skeptic **James Randi** famously put it...

**"No amount of belief makes something a fact."**

Few figures are as iconic in the world of critical thinking as James
Randi. He spent most of his life exposing paranormal frauds,
pseudoscience, and false claims. His most famous initiative was the
**One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge**,1^ a standing offer to
anyone who could demonstrate supernatural abilities under controlled,
bias-free conditions.

Over a thousand hopefuls applied---psychics, mind-readers, faith
healers---but none passed even the preliminary tests. Even famed psychic
Sylvia Browne agreed to participate but then backed out. Under scrutiny,
the magic disappeared.

Randi's challenge perfectly illustrates why critical thinking matters.
Belief, no matter how passionate or widespread, doesn't make something
true. Evidence does. As Randi reminded us, if a claim is real, it should
withstand investigation, not vanish under the spotlight.

## A Litmus Test for Critical Thinkers

One of my favourite quick checks to separate critical thinkers from true
believers is the *Excitement Rule*.

**- The critical thinker lights up when proven wrong.** Their reaction
isn't shame or defensiveness---it's curiosity. A flawed assumption
becomes a puzzle, a chance to refine the mental machine. It's like our
New Brain gets a jolt of energy from shifting to course-correct.

**- The true believer, by contrast, doubles down.** The Old Brain
treats contradiction as a threat. Criticism doesn't feel like
data---it feels like danger. That's when the large gear kicks in,
spinning harder to rationalize and defend the current narrative.

This difference isn't just academic---it's **transformational.**

Critical thinkers don't just *tolerate* uncertainty; they *value* it.
Being wrong isn't failure---it's feedback. It means the gears of growth
are still turning and the journey is still unfolding. That mindset---the
ability to welcome correction rather than fear it---is the clearest sign
that someone is steering with intention, not being driven by impulse.

Now let's get practical.

## Occam's Razor: A Critical Thinking Power Tool

When comparing explanations, Occam's Razor (named after 14th-century
philosopher William of Occam) advises us to favour the one with the
fewest assumptions---the leanest story, not the flashiest. It's not
about picking the simplest slogan (like "God did it"), but avoiding
needlessly complicated theories that bloat an idea with extra parts.

*[Example:]* Before Copernicus, astronomers used complex
"epicycles" to explain why planets seemed to orbit Earth. Copernicus
proposed a simpler model: planets, including Earth, orbit the Sun. That
one shift eliminated layers of clunky math and made far better sense of
the sky.

Occam's Razor isn't a law---it's a mental habit. The more assumptions a
claim needs, the more scrutiny it deserves. Big leaps need big proof.

So next time you're weighing theories---whether it's a strange event at
home or a sweeping historical claim---ask: *"How many hidden assumptions
am I accepting here?"* If it feels like a conspiracy with thirty moving
parts, it's probably worth a double-take.

Cut what's unnecessary. Find the clearest, viable explanation. It's one
of the most reliable tools for keeping your New Brain engaged---and your
Old Brain from chasing wild tales.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Critical Thinking

Below is a reorganized, step-by-step guide that weaves together the
Old/New Brain concept, skepticism vs. belief, and Occam's Razor into a
cohesive framework for critical thinking:

**1. Check your Ego:** Ego is the enemy of progress. It acts like sand
in the gears---clinging to conclusions, defending beliefs as if
they're extensions of our identity. The more accomplished we become,
the more dangerous this trap: intellectual pride blinds us to the
humility required for honest reasoning.

**Why It Matters:** If you cannot admit to yourself that you might be
mistaken in your beliefs, the New Brain will not engage in
metacognition.

**2. Acknowledge Your Two Gears:** Recognize that you possess an Old
Brain driven by emotional, habitual impulses and a New Brain focused
on methodical reasoning. Assume that your Old Brain is likely
shaping your beliefs with the automatic transmission engaged, while
the New Brain rationalizes them.

**Why It Matters:** Knowing both are in play keeps you alert to snap
judgments or biases that might cloud your evaluation.

**3. Engage Metacognition.** Press the clutch. Shift into **New Brain
gear**. Metacognition is your ability to step back and think about
your own thinking---to interrupt the automatic flow and examine what's
really driving your conclusions. **Ask yourself questions like:**

◦ "What's influencing my thinking right now---emotion, habit, fear,
ego?"

◦ "Am I rationalizing this decision or argument instead of reasoning
through it?"

◦ "Am I being deceived by my Old Brain thinking?"

◦ "How did I arrive at this conclusion?"

◦ "Which biases or logical fallacies might be influencing me?"

◦ "Am I rushing to a conclusion because it's familiar, comforting, or
convenient?"

◦ "Is this based on real science or pseudoscience?"

◦ "Is this based on known laws of nature?"

**Why It Matters:** By actively questioning your assumptions and
reasoning, you can catch errors early, avoid overconfidence, and
improve your judgment. In other words, metacognition keeps the New
Brain alert, ready to downshift or course-correct, ensuring your
thinking stays responsive to new evidence rather than stuck in old
patterns.

**4. Clarify the Claim:** Clearly articulate what is being claimed or
proposed. Ask, "What is this person truly saying?"

**Why It Matters:** A vague claim creates confusion. A well-defined
statement assists you in determining precisely what to investigate and
prepares you for examining evidence.

**5. Assess the source:** Who is making the claim, and what is their
credibility or motive? Are they a reputable expert, a random blogger,
or a suspiciously anonymous post on social media?

**Why it matters:** Skepticism versus belief often begins here. If the
source lacks transparency or a proven track record, you'll need
higher-quality evidence before accepting their claims.

**6. Examine the Evidence:** Collect the facts, data, or reasoning
that supports the claim. Is the evidence strong, recent, relevant, or
merely anecdotal or outdated?

**Why It Matters:** A true skeptic asks, "Where's the evidence?" and
weighs it carefully. Belief, on the other hand, often thrives on
sparse data or leaps of logic.

**7. Identify Biases and Fallacies:** Watch for confirmation bias,
cherry-picked data, appeals to emotion over reason, or Old Brain
tribalism rejecting outright counterarguments.

**Why It Matters:** We all fall victim to biases. Becoming aware of
them is step one in breaking their hold. It also helps you see when a
claim hinges on belief rather than sound logic.

**8. Apply Occam's Razor:** Favour the explanation with fewer
assumptions, all else being equal. The more leaps of logic involved,
the stronger the evidence needs to be.

**Why It Matters:** Conspiracies and elaborate beliefs often pile on
complexities. Unless compelling proof says otherwise, a more
straightforward explanation (that doesn't require countless hidden
plots or vast cover-ups) is usually more plausible.

**9. Consider Alternatives:** Brainstorm at least one other way to
explain the situation. Could something more mundane fit the facts?

**Why It Matters:** The Old Brain may push you to latch onto a single
dramatic narrative. By thinking of alternatives, you're nudging your
New Brain to stay flexible and open to different possibilities.

**10. Embrace Skepticism (But Stay Open):** Skepticism involves
maintaining intellectual humility---seeking solid reasons before
accepting a claim and being willing to revise your position. When new,
credible evidence arises, you adapt.

**Why It Matters:** This is the sweet spot between gullible belief and
dismissive cynicism. It lets you ask tough questions ("Show me the
evidence") while still being ready to change your mind if facts call
for it.

**11. Decide and Reflect:** After sifting through evidence, applying
Occam's Razor, and acknowledging both your Old and New Brains, make
your best judgment---but regard it as provisional.

**Why It Matters:** Few things in life are certain for long. By
reflecting on what worked and what didn't, you can enhance your
critical thinking skills, preparing yourself for the next significant
claim that comes your way.

By applying these steps consistently, you keep a firm grip on skepticism
(demanding strong evidence) without letting your Old Brain slip into
rigid belief. Occam's Razor helps you eliminate unnecessary
complications, while the New Brain's careful deliberation ensures that
you remain anchored in reality, not drifting into fantastical narratives
or tribal echo chambers.

## Wrapping It Up

As you *wrap* (pun intended) your mind around the concept of critical
thinking, remember---it's not a one-time lesson you learn and shelve.
It's an ongoing discipline. We must put the New Brain in manual
transmission to shift into thoughtful, deliberate reasoning.

You've explored how biases, emotional shortcuts, and flawed logic can
grind your mental gears and lead you astray. But with practice, you can
override those defaults and navigate more intentionally.

In an age of AI, misinformation, and information overload, being able to
shift mental gears consciously is more than helpful---it's essential. It
allows you to cut through noise, anchor your judgments in reliable
reasoning, and guide your business, brand, and life with integrity.

# **Chapter 8: Emotions and the Reward System**

***\"We are not thinking machines. We are feeling machines that
think.\"***

Antonio Damasio, Neurologist

I'm sure you have felt a surge of excitement just thinking about an
upcoming vacation or a new gadget you're about to buy. Or the constant
urge to check your social media feeds? That's not just a
coincidence---it's your brain's reward system at work.

A few years ago, I walked into a store with a clear mission: buy a
simple jacket---nothing fancy --- just something practical for cooler
weather. But then I saw *it*: a beautifully styled leather jacket, way
out of my planned budget. I tried it on just for fun, telling myself it
was harmless. But the moment I caught my reflection in the mirror,
something shifted. It wasn't about staying warm anymore. It was about
how the jacket made me *feel* --- confident, adventurous, a little bold.

I didn't leave with the practical jacket. I left with the leather one,
my budget blown. I'm sure you are recounting a similar personal story in
your head right now.

It's a perfect example of how emotion and the reward system work. On
paper, logic should have won. But in reality, the instant emotional
reward, that feeling of transformation, overpowered rational
calculation. And the kicker? I *knew* my Old Brain was taking over. My
New Brain tried to justify it by saying, *"At least it's a good story to
use with clients!"*

Every day, whether we're aware of it or not, we're moved more by how
things make us feel than by any checklist of features. Emotional
experiences not only influence our decisions in the moment, but they are
also stored in long-term memory, where they quietly shape future
behaviour. That's why stories and feelings stick, while dry facts often
fade.

Understanding how emotions trigger both the brain's reward pathways
*and* its memory systems is key to shaping behaviour, building brands,
and creating loyalty that facts alone can't buy.

This isn't just interesting, it's essential. If you want to influence
behaviour, whether you're building a brand, leading a team, or even
rewiring your own habits, you need to understand how our emotions,
neurotransmitters, and memories work together to drive what we do.

## The Power of Emotions

Neurologist Antonio Damasio's influential book, Descartes' Error (1994),
challenges the idea that logical reasoning alone guides our
behaviour.1^ Instead, emotions serve as a first filter, ensuring we can
quickly decide what to chase (food, safety, social acceptance) and what
to avoid (danger, rejection, threats). They're like an instant alarm
system, transmitting fear, lust, hunger, or anxiety faster than our
conscious minds can compute risk-reward scenarios.

Damasio illustrates this vividly through the story of Phineas Gage, a
19th-century railroad foreman who survived a freak accident in which an
iron rod blasted through his skull. Though he lived, his personality and
behaviour changed dramatically. Damasio used 3D software to reconstruct
Gage's brain and discovered that the neural pathways connecting the Old
Brain's emotion-rich regions to the New Brain's reasoning-focused
neocortex had been severed.

**Emotions arenʼt just fleeting feelings to be tamed or ignored. Theyʼre
deeply integrated into the machinery that keeps us alive, helps us
thrive, and shapes our personal identities.**

The Old Brain tunes in to emotional cues, fear tells us to run,
disgust warns us to avoid something harmful, and happiness
nudges us toward what feels good. Meanwhile, the New Brain can refine,
interpret, and channel these emotional impulses into socially acceptable
behaviours or strategic plans.

**Why does this matter for business, brand building, or everyday
decision-making? Because the interplay between feeling and thinking
underlies almost everything we do.**

You might fancy yourself a rational actor, methodically weighing pros
and cons. Still, deep down, we now know your Old Brain supplies the
emotional motivations that direct where your attention goes and how much
you're willing to risk. Recognizing the impact of these emotions, both
in ourselves and others, opens the door to better self-awareness, more
empathetic communication, and a more substantial capacity to spot when
our biases or "gut instincts" might be misleading us.

Damasio's catchphrase, "We are feeling machines that think", is more
than a clever turn of phrase. It's a call to honour the power of
emotions in guiding human action. Rather than treating emotions as
obstacles, understanding them as essential drivers helps us craft more
resonant messages in marketing, develop deeper bonds with customers, and
steer our personal and professional decisions with a clearer sense of
balance between emotional intuition and rational deliberation.

Chapter 2 looked at the brain's remarkable network of 86 billion neurons
and their 100 trillion synaptic connections. These tiny junctions (see
illustration) don't just transmit electrical and chemical messages
between neurons; they form the communication highway that powers every
thought, feeling, and action.

But these signals aren't just mechanical relays. Neurotransmitters and
hormones play a far deeper role, shaping **our emotional landscape**.
When the Old Brain senses a threat, a reward, or even a compelling
story, these chemical messengers spring into action, triggering
everything from fear and joy to trust and anticipation.

Modern neuroscience shows that specific neurotransmitters align with
particular emotional states, helping explain why a powerful movie or
novel can move us to tears, make us anxious, or leave us inspired. In
branding, this emotional ignition is **pure gold**. In an upcoming
chapter, we'll dive deeper into the impact of storytelling and how to
harness it.

## Key Neurotransmitters & Hormones

## Dopamine: The Anticipation Neurotransmitter

Often nicknamed the anticipation or "reward" neurotransmitter,
dopamine is less about the reward itself and more about the
desire2^ for that reward.

**Think of it as fuel for your Old Brain: It revs up your excitement and
motivation when something tantalizing is on the horizon.**

Your Old Brain detects a potential "win" (like a fantastic deal or an
intriguing new gadget) and releases dopamine, which energizes your
pursuit. The New Brain might chime in with a rational plan, "Should I
wait for a sale?"---but often, the Old Brain's excitement takes the
lead. Once you obtain the thing you've been chasing, dopamine levels
usually drop.

**Business and Branding Implications**

**- Promotions and Teasers:** Build anticipation with sneak peeks,
countdowns, or early-bird specials, triggering that dopamine rush.

**- Gamification:** Introduce challenges, achievements, or loyalty
programs; each "win" or reward reactivates that Old Brain pursuit.

**- Product Launches:** Hype up a new product or service with just
enough detail to spark curiosity but not enough to satisfy it, keeping
dopamine-driven interest high until launch day.

Dopamine was essential to our evolution. It acted as a reward signal,
motivating us to seek out food, shelter, and other survival essentials
we didn't yet possess. It's the neurochemical fuel behind our drive for
progress, exploration, and the pursuit of "more."

But that same fuel comes with a dark side. Dopamine is **highly
addictive**.3^ Substances like cocaine, heroin, nicotine, and even
alcohol either flood the brain with dopamine or block its natural
regulation, hijacking the system that once helped us survive. They crank
the engine into overdrive precisely when we most need control.

**And here's the problem:** when dopamine levels spike out of control,
our ability to shift into manual transmission, our New Brain mode,
diminishes. The Old Brain revs the engine, chasing short-term pleasure,
while the clutch that engages deliberate reasoning slips. We lose the
capacity to slow down, question, and redirect our thoughts.

High dopamine doesn't just make us impulsive; it makes it harder to
*choose* not to be.

That's why awareness is key. Understanding how this neurotransmitter
influences our cravings and decision-making is the first step in
regaining control. Because if we can recognize when dopamine is
steering, we can press the clutch, engage the New Brain, and take back
the driver's seat.

## Serotonin: The Mood Stabilizer

If dopamine is the brain's accelerator, serotonin is the brake. It helps
regulate mood, appetite, and overall well-being. Think of it as your
**emotional thermostat**,4^ preventing you from spiralling into anxiety
or discontent. When dopamine has the Old Brain flooring it toward the
next reward, serotonin gives the New Brain space to ease off the gas and
reflect.

In this way, serotonin helps engage the clutch, allowing the brain to
shift into a calmer, more measured gear. It brings balance to the rush,
allowing us to pause, feel gratitude, and maintain emotional
equilibrium.

Low serotonin levels have been strongly linked to mood disorders like
depression and anxiety. Conversely, stable serotonin levels correlate
with a sense of peace, patience, and contentment. This is why
medications such as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are
often prescribed to help stabilize this chemical and, with it, the
mind's internal rhythm.

In the dance between impulse and reason, between the Old Brain and the
New, serotonin plays a vital moderating role. It helps us not just chase
what we want, but value what we already have.

**Business and Branding Implications**

**- Customer Satisfaction:** Positive brand interactions, such as a
warm greeting or an easy return policy, can spark serotonin, making
customers feel more at ease.

**- Mindful Messaging:** Brands focusing on relaxation, mental health,
or calmness can appeal to customers seeking serotonin-rich
experiences.

**- Retention Strategies:** A content, serene customer is a loyal
customer. Continual positive experiences help maintain steady
serotonin levels, thereby reinforcing brand loyalty.

## Oxytocin: The Trust Hormone

Oxytocin is the neurochemical that greases the gears of social bonding.
Often referred to as the "love hormone," it plays a crucial role in
attachment, empathy, and trust. Oxytocin is released during moments of
connection, whether hugging a loved one, bonding with a newborn, or
building rapport with a teammate.5^ It signals to the Old Brain that a
situation is safe and that social closeness is beneficial for survival.

From a branding perspective, oxytocin is why stories, testimonials, and
shared struggles are so compelling. When we feel connected to others, we
become more receptive, our defensive Old Brain loosens its grip, and our
New Brain can **engage more openly**.6^ This makes oxytocin critical in
cultivating brand loyalty, team dynamics, and trust-building
interactions.

**Business and Branding Implications**

**- Community Building:** Fostering user groups, fan clubs, or brand
communities can amplify oxytocin, forging strong brand loyalties.

**- Empathetic Storytelling:** Real testimonials or heartfelt
narratives build trust and emotional warmth.

**- Genuine Interactions:** Moments of personalized service or sincere
apologies can transform customer service calls into bond-building
experiences.

## Endorphins: The Bodyʼs Natural Painkillers

Endorphins are the brain's natural opioids, released in response to
pain, stress, and vigorous activity like exercise or laughter. They dull
discomfort and elevate mood, acting as a kind of emotional shock
absorber.7^ Think of endorphins as the gear lubricant: when friction
gets high, they help reduce wear and tear.

But the catch? Endorphins don't last long. They provide temporary
relief, not long-term satisfaction. This is why people chase highs,
whether from a great run, a hilarious video, or an addictive app. These
small bursts of pleasure can trick the Old Brain into thinking
everything's fine, even when it's not. The New Brain needs to stay alert
and question whether we're addressing the root issue or just masking the
symptoms.

**Business and Branding Implications**

**- Fitness Brands:** Endorphins are prominently used in exercise, so
many health and wellness brands emphasize post-workout euphoria to
retain customers.

**- Experiential Marketing:** Events that challenge people (fun runs,
obstacle courses) generate endorphin highs, creating positive brand
associations.

**- Positive Challenges:** Turn tasks into playful, mildly demanding
activities. For example, a brand that offers "30-day challenges" can
trigger endorphin bursts each time a milestone is reached.

## Testosterone: The Competitive Drive Hormone

Testosterone fuels the Old Brain's hunger for dominance, recognition,
and social rank. While it's often linked to masculinity, testosterone
plays a crucial role in all genders, just in differing levels. Rather
than simply triggering aggression8^, testosterone sharpens the desire
to win, excel, and assert influence. It's the hormone that revs the
engine when status is on the line.

In branding or business, this manifests as ambition, competitiveness, or
the drive to outshine rivals; emotional triggers the Old Brain responds
to instinctively. A leaderboard, a limited-edition badge, or a message
that signals "you'll be ahead of the pack" taps directly into this
circuitry.

But testosterone-fuelled behaviour isn't just brute instinct. The New
Brain can take the wheel, shifting those impulses into strategic
positioning, calculated risk-taking, or confident leadership. When the
gears are aligned, testosterone can be a catalyst for visionary action,
not just a visceral reaction.

**Business and Branding Implications**

**- Competitive Marketing:** Brands can harness competitive instincts.
Think "Our product outperforms the competition!" to stir excitement.

**- Leaderboards & Rivalries:** Gamified systems that rank users can
spark those Old Brain competitive urges.

**- Achievement-Focused Messaging:** Emphasizing challenges,
achievements, or "winning" can appeal to the part of us that wants to
rise above the rest.

## Adrenaline & Cortisol: The Stress Duo

While not typically associated with pleasure, adrenaline (also known as
epinephrine) and cortisol are essential for understanding how the Old
Brain responds to perceived threats. These two neurochemicals are the
fast and slow engines of the stress response, each activating different
parts of our mental machinery.

**- Adrenaline** delivers a jolt of energy and hyper-focus. It's the
Old Brain flooring the gas pedal---blood pumps faster, senses sharpen,
and the body prepares to act now. This is why you feel a spike of
excitement during countdown timers or flash sales.

**- Cortisol**, on the other hand, is the long-haul regulator. It
keeps the system on alert, sustaining vigilance under prolonged
stress. But when cortisol levels stay high, especially in environments
of chronic fear, pressure, or urgency, the Old Brain's large gear
keeps spinning, making it harder for the New Brain to shift into
conscious control. The result? **Reactivity replaces reflection**.9^

In branding, this duo can be powerful. Tactics such as FOMO, scarcity,
or risk aversion messaging activate these systems. Used sparingly and
ethically, they spark attention and prompt action. However, overuse can
lead to brand fatigue, anxiety, or distrust, causing customers to feel
manipulated rather than motivated.

The key is modulation. Invite the Old Brain into motion with adrenaline
and cortisol cues---then shift into manual transmission, offering the
New Brain clarity, logic, and a clear path forward. When these gears
work in harmony, urgency becomes motivation, not manipulation.

## Wrapping it Up

Antonio Damasio was right when he said we are "feeling machines that
think." Emotions aren't just side effects of cognition---they're central
to how we perceive, decide, connect, and remember. When we embrace that
truth---personally and professionally---we unlock richer experiences and
forge more meaningful relationships.

Neurotransmitters and hormones may be invisible, but their influence on
our thinking is profound. They shape the ongoing interplay between the
Old Brain's instinctive impulses and the New Brain's rational control.
Whether it's dopamine driving us to seek, serotonin calming the mind,
oxytocin building trust, or adrenaline pushing us into action, these
chemicals not only guide our choices---they help encode the emotional
intensity of those moments into memory.

That's why emotionally resonant experiences---whether personal or
brand-related---are the ones we tend to recall and revisit. When a
message aligns with our biological wiring, it doesn't just sell---it
sticks.

Add story to the equation, and you amplify emotional highs, build
empathy, and create lasting impressions that bypass the filters of logic
and lodge deep in memory. It's not manipulation---it's resonance.

This isn't about hacking the brain. It's about respecting what it means
to be human. By aligning your message with what truly
matters---excitement, safety, purpose, and connection---you help both
gears of the Divided Brain work together smoothly.

quick visual summary of the key neurochemicals we've covered and how
they influence behaviour.

# **Chapter 9: The Big Three Emotional Instincts**

**"Nothing truly great happens without some pain, and nothing truly
lasting without love."**

Scott Galloway, The Algebra of Happiness (2019)

Do you wonder why certain brands \"get\" you on a deeper level? Or why
some messages resonate so profoundly that they move you to action
without a second thought? It all boils down to our most basic emotional
instincts.

As we learned in the last chapter, logical arguments appeal to the New
Brain, but if you want to influence behaviour, you must **engage
emotions** to capture the Old Brain's attention. When your message
activates those deep emotional triggers, it effortlessly turns the big
gear---there's no need to press the clutch or manually shift into
rational mode.

In *The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google*
(2017), Professor Scott Galloway explains how today's most powerful
brands bypass logic and **speak directly to primal urges.** He organizes
these emotional levers into what he calls **"The Big Three"**1^:

**1. The Heart** -- Our need for love, connection, and belonging.

**2. The Gut** -- The instinct to gather, hoard, and protect
resources.

**3. The Privates** -- The reproductive drive to attract, impress, and
pass on our genes.

Tapping into these emotional drivers is like staying in low gear on a
steep hill---it gives the Old Brain all the torque it needs to act
without hesitation, while the New Brain stays in cruise mode. Marketers
who rely solely on logic are asking the smaller gear to do all the work.
But when you target the Heart, Gut, and Privates, the message moves
smoothly through the system, and action follows almost automatically.

## The Heart

It's no coincidence that we often refer to our "heart" when describing
strong emotions. The heart has long symbolized love, belonging,
compassion, altruism, values, and even spirituality. Think about the
warmth you feel in the company of close friends or family---that's the
heart in action.

But this isn't just poetic language. The need for connection is deeply
ingrained in our biology. Feelings of love and belonging aren't
emotional fluff; they're essential survival mechanisms. When these
emotions are triggered, the larger gear turns smoothly, propelling us
toward community, cooperation, and mutual support.

Whether we're building families, tribes, teams, or brands, the heart
remains a reliable ignition point---an emotional spark that gets the
whole system moving, long before the New Brain has a chance to shift
into gear.

Let's explore some of the Heart's traits, starting with the most
important one.

## Love and Belonging

**"People who have the most quality relationships with others are
happier, healthier, and live longer. Loneliness is toxic and kills."**

Robert Waldinger

This insight from Robert Waldinger, director of the Harvard Study of
Adult Development, underscores the vital role of relationships in human
well-being. Quality relationships significantly enhance our happiness,
health, and overall well-being. The Old Brain's focus on love and
belonging comes from an evolutionary need for social bonds---mutual
support, resource sharing, and protection.

**Key Insights from Harvard Study:**

**- Relationships and Well-Being:** Enhance happiness and health.

**- Loneliness is Harmful:** Comparable to smoking or obesity in its
adverse effects.

**- Quality Over Quantity:** Deep relationships are more beneficial.

**- Lifelong Impact:** Midlife relationships predict future health.

**- Emotional Intelligence:** Essential for sustaining relationships.

**Communication Strategies for Love and Belonging:**

**- Foster Community:** Create spaces for customer interaction, such
as online forums, in-person events, or exclusive membership areas.

*[Example:]* The Running Room's "Run Club" app fosters a
sense of community by organizing group runs and events, thereby helping
members feel connected and supported.

**- Emphasize Shared Values:** Connect with your audience through
values-driven marketing that highlights shared beliefs and community
purpose, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.

*[Example:]* Patagonia emphasizes environmental activism and
ethical production, aligning with sustainability-conscious customers.

## Altruism

Have you ever experienced a rush of happiness after helping someone?
Altruism, which is the selfless concern for others, is deeply ingrained
in us. From an evolutionary perspective, we are more inclined to help
close family members because it ensures the passage of our genes (kin
selection), and we also assist those outside our family to foster
relationships and encourage cooperation (reciprocal altruism). Altruism
serves not only as a means of ensuring survival through collaboration
but also enhances our emotional well-being by making us feel more
connected to others. When we help others, we experience a sense of
purpose and fulfillment that adds meaning to our lives.

Altruism also plays a vital role in building and maintaining
communities. It cultivates trust, cooperation, and mutual respect, all
of which are essential for a thriving society. When people observe a
company genuinely caring about the well-being of others, it generates
goodwill and loyalty, making customers more likely to support that
brand.

**Companies that give back can strengthen their connection with
customers.**

**Communication Strategies for Altruism:**

**- Promote Altruistic Initiatives:** Commit to social and
environmental causes through corporate social responsibility (CSR)
initiatives.

*[Example:]* LUSH Cosmetics Canada partners with
organizations like the Ocean Legacy Foundation to support ocean clean-up
efforts, emphasizing transparency and positive environmental impact.

-Encourage Customer Participation: Engage customers in philanthropic
activities like donations and volunteer events.

*[Example:]* Our radio stations raised over \$4 million for
local hospitals through "Radio for..." campaigns, hosting radiothons,
concerts, and partnering with community groups.

## Empathy: The Emotional Bridge Between Gears

Empathy---the ability to understand and share another's feelings---is
more than a soft skill. It's a bridge between the Old Brain's primal
emotions and the New Brain's higher reasoning. While fear, lust, and
hunger kept us alive, empathy helped us thrive, strengthening social
bonds, trust, and cooperation.

From an evolutionary lens, empathy was a survival tool. It bonded
tribes, encouraged mutual care, and satisfied the Old Brain's need for
social safety while activating the New Brain's capacity for compassion
and moral reflection.

In branding and leadership, empathy engages both gears. The Old Brain
**feels seen** when a brand truly understands a customer's frustration
or desire. But it's the follow-through---clear solutions and respectful
action---that convinces the New Brain it's a relationship worth keeping.

Empathy creates not just buyers, but believers.

**Communication Strategies for Empathy**

**- Active Listening and Responsiveness:** Demonstrate to customers
that you're paying attention to their questions, concerns, and
feedback.

*[Example:]* A brand that responds personally to social
media comments or customer emails within a reasonable timeframe
demonstrates genuine care and concern. It's not just a generic
auto-reply; it's a human touch that says, "We see you."

**- Personalized Solutions:** Tailor your offerings to individual
needs. This may involve recommending specific products or tailoring
experiences based on actual user data.

*[Example:]* Online fitness platforms that adapt workout
routines to each person's goals and limitations, expressing empathy for
diverse fitness journeys.

**Empathy isn't just emotional. It's strategic.** It strengthens loyalty
by appealing to our need for connection and our desire to be understood.
When brands lead with empathy, they move from being tolerated to being
trusted---and remembered.

## Reciprocity

Reciprocity is the concept that compels individuals to return a favour
when someone does something for them. It serves as a powerful driver of
cooperation and trust within communities. For instance, when a brand
provides a free trial or sample, customers often feel encouraged to
purchase in return, fostering a sense of mutual benefit. This principle
of reciprocity is also evident in loyalty programs, where customers earn
points or rewards that motivate them to continue supporting the brand.
Such initiatives create a continuous cycle of giving and receiving,
strengthening the connections and trust between the brand and its
customers.

**Communication Strategies for Reciprocity:**

**- Loyalty Programs:** Reward customers to encourage repeat business.

*[Example:]* Tim Hortons\' "Tim's Rewards" is a points-based
loyalty program in which frequent customers earn points toward free
drinks and food, incentivizing them to return. For U.S. readers, think
Dunkin'.

**- Encourage Referrals:** Motivate customers to refer friends by
offering incentives and rewards.

*[Example:]* Koodo Mobile offers bill credits to customers
who refer new users, creating a reciprocal exchange that benefits both
the customer and the brand.

## Positive Morals & Values

Morals and values are social norms that evolve within groups to
encourage cooperative behaviour, mitigate conflict, and establish
stability. These norms are reinforced through cultural evolution,
ensuring that practices that support group survival are passed down
through generations. Positive morals and values promote prosocial
behaviours such as trust, fairness, and justice, thereby enhancing group
cohesion and collaboration.

**Communication Strategies for Positive Moral Values:**

**- Align with Positive Values:** Ensure your brand's values align
with those of your audience.

*[Example:]* Patagonia aligns with environmental
sustainability to attract eco-conscious consumers.

**- Highlight Ethical Practices:** Showcase your commitment to ethical
actions and transparency.

*[Example:]* Ben & Jerry\'s highlights their fair trade and
sustainable sourcing practices.

## Aspirations

We all have dreams and goals that propel us forward. Aspirations drive
us to better ourselves and our standing in the world. From an
evolutionary perspective, striving for better resources, enhanced
skills, or elevated social status increases an individual's chances of
securing mates and resources for themselves and their offspring.
Aspirations foster goal-directed behaviour and innovation, contributing
to personal and societal advancement.

**Brands that inspire can motivate customers to take action.**

**Communication Strategies for Aspirations:**

**- Inspire Through Vision:** Use visionary messaging to align
customer goals with your brand's mission.

*[Example:]* Tesla\'s sustainable future vision inspires
customers to adopt electric vehicles.

**- Support Growth:** Offer products and services that aid personal
development.

*[Example:]* MasterClass offers courses taught by industry
experts to help customers acquire new skills.

## Turning Negative Emotions into Positive Emotions

While the Heart metaphor often evokes love, connection, and belonging,
it's just as important to acknowledge the power of negative emotions,
like sadness, rejection, and low self-worth. These feelings can stall
the Old Brain and disrupt the smooth engagement between our two mental
gears.

Brands and leaders who recognize these states and respond with empathy
and reassurance can help get things moving again. Whether it's a
compassionate reply to a negative review, support for a burned-out team
member, or a product that makes someone feel seen, these actions help
the Old Brain feel safe, allowing the New Brain to re-engage.

When done with authenticity, this emotional shift doesn't just fix a
problem---it creates a lasting impression. People remember not just what
you did, but how you made them feel. That's what turns a stalled moment
into forward momentum.

## Low Self-Esteem: Rewiring the Internal Dialogue

Low self-esteem begins internally but shapes how people see the world,
make decisions, and connect with brands. It's not just a passing
feeling---it's a pattern of self-doubt that causes the Old Brain to spin
in search of safety and reassurance, while the New Brain struggles to
engage with confidence.

This vulnerability often stems from **perceived inadequacy or
rejection**, leading people to seek solutions that restore a sense of
worth, visibility, or voice. For brands, this isn't a cue to
exploit---it's a chance to be an ally.

By recognizing these emotional undercurrents, brands can offer
meaningful support through inclusive messaging, uplifting stories, or
products that promote growth, care, or self-expression. These actions
help shift the mental transmission from doubt to a sense of dignity.

The goal isn't surface-level affirmation, but **deeper empowerment.**
When the New Brain finally catches and drives forward, that shift builds
absolute trust and lasting loyalty.

**Communication Strategies for Low Self-Esteem**

-Encouraging Empowerment: Brands that focus on empowerment help
customers feel capable, confident, and valued.

*[Example:]* Dove's celebrated "Real Beauty" campaign,
launched in 2004, prominently challenged conventional standards of
beauty by highlighting diverse, real-world portrayals of women. The
campaign is widely recognized in branding circles for shifting
perceptions around beauty standards and powerfully demonstrating the
impact brands can have by authentically reflecting their customers'
values.

**- Fostering Community and Belonging:** Feelings of loneliness and
rejection are closely tied to low self-esteem. Brands that build
inclusive communities can help customers feel seen, heard, and
supported.

*[Example:]* Online fitness programs that emphasize
community support, such as Peloton, create environments where
participants cheer each other on, thereby enhancing motivation and a
sense of belonging.

**- Inspiring Aspirational Messaging:** Aspirational branding can help
customers envision their best selves, offering products or services as
stepping stones to achieving their goals.

*[Example:]* Nike's "Just Do It" campaign motivates
individuals to overcome self-doubt and take action, tying the brand to
resilience and achievement.

## Sadness: A Signal to Shift Gears

Often seen as a negative emotion, sadness is actually one of the oldest
and most adaptive responses of the Old Brain. It's not a flaw---it's a
feature. Evolutionarily, sadness helped our ancestors process loss,
pause impulsive behaviour, and seek support. Whether from grief, lost
status, or survival threats, it signalled a need to slow down and
reconnect with others.

Today, sadness still plays a vital role. It signals that something
core---love, purpose, connection---has been disrupted. The Old Brain
hits the emotional brakes, opening the door for the New Brain to shift
gears, reflect, and recalibrate.

For marketers and strategists, understanding sadness isn't about
exploiting it---it's about responding to it with empathy. Campaigns that
acknowledge human struggle and offer hope, support, or resilience build
powerful emotional resonance. When brands help people feel seen and
offer a path forward, they create a real connection.

Sadness slows the tempo between emotion and reason. Brands that honour
that rhythm don't just gain attention---they earn emotional trust.

**Communication Strategies for Sadness**

**- Evoke Empathy Through Storytelling:** Share authentic narratives
that reflect real struggles your audience can relate to. Emotional
resonance builds connection and trust.

*[Example:]* Mental health campaigns often feature stories
of personal resilience alongside supportive messaging. *Kids Help
Phone*, for instance, offers 24/7 access to compassionate resources for
Canadian youth, validating emotions while providing practical support.

**- Balance Sadness with Hope and Action:** Acknowledge pain, but show
a path forward. Offer reassurance, support, or tangible ways your
audience can help or contribute to healing.

*[Example:]* Disaster relief organizations use emotional
imagery not just to spotlight suffering, but to show how donations fuel
real recovery, turning grief into meaningful impact.

## Loneliness: The Old Brain's Social Alarm

Loneliness isn't just a feeling---it's a survival signal hardwired into
the Old Brain. In early human history, separation from the group meant
danger and reduced chances of survival. That uneasy feeling when we're
alone? It's the Old Brain urging reconnection.

Even in a hyper-connected world, loneliness persists. Ironically,
digital interactions can amplify it, replacing deep connection with
surface-level engagement. The Old Brain still signals distress, but it's
often drowned out by busy routines or social fragmentation.

This is where the New Brain must shift gears---consciously slowing down,
reflecting, and taking steps to re-engage. Brands that recognize this
emotional gap and respond with authentic empathy---through storytelling,
community, or customer care---can help guide that shift.

By fostering inclusion, shared identity, and respect, brands can become
more than service providers---they can become **trusted companions**,
answering the Old Brain's call while helping the New Brain navigate
forward.

**Communication Strategies for Loneliness**

**- Create a Sense of Belonging:** Position your brand as a community
or a source of connection, emphasizing inclusivity and shared values.

*[Example:]* Outdoor clothing brands like Patagonia
highlight environmental activism, creating a sense of purpose-driven
community.

**- Shared Experiences:** Promote group activities. Create forums,
events, or social media spaces where your customers can engage with
one another.

*[Example:]* Peloton's live classes foster a sense of
community by allowing participants to engage with instructors and one
another in real-time, creating a shared experience.

## Why Turning Negative Emotions Around Matters for Brands

Addressing negative emotions like low self-esteem isn't just a loyalty
tactic---it's a chance to create real emotional resonance. When brands
recognize and respond to subtle signals of discomfort, they activate the
Old Brain's drive for safety, validation, and a sense of belonging. But
recognition alone isn't enough. The real impact comes when brands help
customers shift from self-doubt to self-worth.

The Old Brain often spins in fear, shame, and comparison. But when a
brand responds with **empathy and encouragement**, it gives the New
Brain a chance to pause, reflect, and reframe. That shift---from
automatic self-criticism to conscious self-compassion---turns
transactions **into trust.**

By showing up as a guide instead of just a seller, your brand becomes
part of a customer's emotional growth. When people feel seen and
uplifted, they don't just buy---they believe. They return, advocate, and
associate your brand with strength and hope.

In doing so, you're not just speaking to emotion---you're empowering
reason. That's where fundamental transformation and lasting loyalty
begin.

Next, we'll explore the second of the Big Three emotional instincts:
**The Gut**.

## The Gut

How often have you said---or heard---phrases like, "My gut tells me...,"
"I've got a bad feeling," or "That was just a gut reaction"? These
aren't just figures of speech. They reflect a deep-rooted connection
between our physiological instincts and our Old Brain's decision-making.

Using the "gut" analogy for the Old Brain helps us understand why
certain behaviours---like hoarding, craving security, or acting on
impulse---are so instinctive. Just as your gut reacts to what you
consume, your Old Brain reacts to your environment without pausing for
reasoned analysis. It turns the large gear effortlessly when something
feels urgent, uncertain, or potentially threatening.

The Gut is all about resource acquisition and preservation. Whether it's
food, money, safety, or social capital, the Old Brain's gut-level
instinct says: "Better grab it now." It's why scarcity sells, urgency
drives clicks, and FOMO campaigns get results.

Understanding the gut's influence is vital for **brand strategy.** When
your messaging speaks directly to that visceral part of the Old Brain,
you create an instinctive pull before the logic of the New Brain even
kicks in.

Let's delve into the Gut's **traits and characteristics:**

## Scarcity

For our ancestors, starvation and malnutrition were the main threats to
survival. The urge to seek and gather resources was crucial during times
of food scarcity and unpredictability. This instinct helped individuals
and their communities survive difficult periods of deprivation.

**Communication Strategies for Scarcity:**

**- Emphasize Scarcity and Urgency:** Highlight limited-time offers or
exclusive products to trigger the Old Brain's instinct to gather
resources before they run out.

*[Example:]* *Nike* regularly releases limited-edition
sneakers through "drops," prompting customers to buy quickly or miss
out---triggering FOMO and a sense of urgency.

**- Promote Security and Reliability:** Position your brand as a
dependable source that ensures customers have what they need.

*[Example:]* *Costco* emphasizes bulk savings and stocked
essentials, especially during crises, positioning itself as a dependable
supplier in times of uncertainty.

## Gathering and Hoarding

Gathering and hoarding have always played roles beyond mere survival
during scarcity. Recall how toilet paper vanished from stores at the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic? Our tendency to gather and hoard is
rooted in our evolutionary background as hunter-gatherers. In these
primitive societies, collecting essential resources like food, tools,
and materials was vital for both survival and reproductive success.
Hunter-gatherers relied on their skills to gather provisions during
**times of abundance** to prepare for inevitable hard times. This
behaviour was not only about individual survival but also about
safeguarding the well-being of the whole group. The innate urge to
gather and hoard created a protective buffer against environmental
unpredictability, enhancing community resilience and continuity.

**Communication Strategies for Instinctive Gathering:**

**- Highlight Abundance and Value:** Showcase the abundance and value
of your offerings, encouraging customers to stock up and take
advantage of the opportunity.

*[Example:]* *Amazon's Subscribe & Save* program encourages
customers to stock up regularly on essentials, reinforcing the comfort
of abundance and convenience.

**- Create Bundled Offers:** Offer product bundles or bulk discounts
to cater to the instinct to accumulate.

*[Example:]* Loblaws' "Buy More, Save More" promotions
reward customers for stocking up. For US readers, think Publix.

## Overabundance in the Modern World

Our instinct to collect and hoard, whether during times of scarcity or
plenty, often clashes with our current environment, where starvation or
resource shortages are not significant concerns.

This instinct to stockpile explains why we live in a world brimming with
resources. Our refrigerators are filled with food we frequently forget,
our cupboards are crammed with rarely used items, and our closets hold
clothing that still has its price tags. From binge-watching countless
streaming services to buying gadgets we don't require simply because
they are on sale, our Old Brain is stuck in survival mode, failing to
realize that abundance doesn't automatically ensure safety.

Fortunately, you're now aware of this Old Brain behaviour and can
activate the New Brain to curb unnecessary excess. However, it requires
effort and a constant reassessment of what you possess and what you
truly need.

**Communication Strategies for Overabundance:**

**- Simplify Choices:** Offer curated selections to help customers
avoid decision fatigue.

*[Example:]* Indigo's "Staff Picks" provides curated book
recommendations, reducing overwhelm. For US readers, think Barnes &
Noble.

**- Organize and Streamline:** Present products in an organized manner
to make it easy for customers to find what they need.

*[Example:]* IKEA's store layout guides customers through a
streamlined, step-by-step process.

## The Hedonistic Treadmill

The Old Brain\'s tendency to gather and hoard establishes a cycle where
each new acquisition becomes the new norm. This cycle hinders lasting
satisfaction because the Old Brain quickly adapts to the new level of
resources, resetting our baseline of happiness. As a result, the initial
excitement diminishes, and new desires arise to keep pace with the
ever-increasing standards.

This continuous loop of the larger gear fosters a sense of inadequacy
and ongoing dissatisfaction, as reaching one goal merely intensifies the
desire for the next.

**The Old Brain\'s drive for more becomes a Hedonistic Treadmill** we
can never escape**, fostering chronic unhappiness despite material or
experiential gains.**

**Communication Strategies for Hedonistic Treadmill:**

**- Highlight Longevity and Timelessness:** Emphasize lasting value to
reduce the need for constant acquisition.

*[Example:]* Roots promotes timeless, high-quality apparel
that lasts.

**- Encourage Minimalism:** Promote owning fewer, higher-quality
items.

*[Example:]* Matt & Nat focuses on quality and
sustainability, encouraging consumers to buy less but better.

## Money as the New Food

In today's world, money has eclipsed food as the primary resource we
pursue. While our ancestors hunted for calories, we now chase dollars
and digits. To the Old Brain, the instinct remains unchanged: **gather,
hoard, protect.**

Money isn't just about buying power---it signals safety, control, and
status. That's why financial stress feels "gut-wrenching." The Old Brain
equates money with survival, and when it senses a threat to income or
security, it overrides the New Brain's rational thinking.

Unlike food, money has no natural stopping point. The Old Brain's drive
to accumulate can run unchecked, which is why scarcity or status-driven
marketing can trigger compulsive behaviour, even when it undermines
long-term well-being.

For brands, understanding this instinct is powerful. When you position a
product as a path to security or prestige, you light up the Old Brain's
survival response. Done ethically, this builds value and reassurance.
Used recklessly, it fuels anxiety and exploitation.

**Communication Strategies for Money as the New Food:**

**- Financial Empowerment:** Market products that empower customers to
achieve economic security.

*[Example:]* Wealthsimple promotes easy and accessible
investing, aligning with people's desire for financial security.

**- Exclusive Benefits:** Offer exclusive memberships or premium
services to provide a sense of status and security.

*[Example:]* *American Express Platinum* members receive
airport lounge access, concierge services, and travel protections,
reinforcing both exclusivity and peace of mind.

## The Modern Gut: Balancing Instinct and Intellect

Despite living in a world of abundance, our Old Brain still runs on
ancient wiring. It doesn't understand moderation---it only knows "more
is better." That's why urges to buy, consume, or hoard can feel so
overpowering.

Recognizing that these gut reactions are rooted in survival instincts
helps us respond with compassion, but also caution. These instincts
aren't wrong---they're just misaligned with modern life. When the Old
Brain revs too hard, the New Brain must clutch in and shift gears.

Simple habits---like mindful consumption, pausing before a purchase, or
asking "Do I need this?"---give the New Brain a chance to regain
control. Even something as small as taking a breath before clicking
"buy" can restore balance.

In the end, managing the Gut means letting instinct guide without
letting it dominate. By consciously shifting gears, we can navigate
modern abundance with more clarity, discipline, and purpose.

## Negative Emotions of the Gut: Pain Points

We've all said, "I have a bad feeling in my gut." These visceral
reactions aren't random---they're survival tools from our evolutionary
past. Emotions like fear, anxiety, anger, and disgust evolved to warn us
of danger and protect our social standing. They're powered by the Old
Brain's larger gear.

But in modern life, where threats are rarely life-or-death, these gut
responses can misfire. A missed promotion or a negative headline can
trigger the same primal alarm bells once reserved for predators, leading
to stress, overreaction, and conflict.

Modern institutions---from politics to marketing---know how to exploit
this. **Fear and outrage are powerful motivators.** Whether it's a
time-sensitive sale or a divisive message, the Gut reacts fast---often
before the New Brain can ask, "Is this really a threat?"

By recognizing how easily these emotions are triggered, we give the New
Brain a chance to step in, reframe the moment, and shift from reflex to
reason. The goal isn't to silence the Gut---but to listen wisely and
respond intentionally.

## Fear and Anxiety

As we've seen, the Old Brain craves stability and predictability. It
prefers familiar paths where outcomes feel certain. The unknown triggers
caution---while an unexpected gain is nice, the Old Brain can't measure
how good it might be. But a potential loss? That's instantly
threatening. Risk, even imagined, makes the Old Brain recoil.

Fear is a powerful lever in this system. The Old Brain scans
constantly for danger---real or perceived---and when it detects a
threat, it reacts fast. Fear floods the system like oil on the wrong
gear, causing the Old Brain to spin harder and drown out the slower,
more deliberate New Brain.

In high-anxiety moments, reasoning slips. The clutch between gears
disengages, and instinct takes over. Politicians, marketers, and
influencers know this well. By triggering fear---whether about finances,
social status, or personal security---they lock the Old Brain into high
gear, prompting fast, often irrational action.

Understanding this provides a strategic advantage. If your brand offers
clarity, stability, or relief, you downshift that emotional overdrive
and allow the New Brain to re-engage. You're not just solving a
problem---**you're easing fear and restoring trust.**

When fear is seen not just as an emotion, but as a full-body gear
response, your message can become the stabilizing force customers crave.

**Communication Strategies for Gut Negative Emotions**

**- Offering Solutions to Customer Wants:** Help your customer or
prospect by engaging the New Brain. When faced with apprehension
caused by fear or frustration, the New Brain is nudged to rationalize
solutions offered by your product or service.

*[Example:]* *TurboTax* provides step-by-step guidance and
real-time support during tax season, reducing anxiety and helping users
feel confident in a typically stressful process.

**- Building Resilience through Supportive Communities:** Creating
communities around the brand where individuals can share experiences
and support each other helps mitigate negative emotions and fosters
loyalty.

*[Example:]* Lululemon hosts community yoga events,
fostering a supportive environment that builds emotional resilience and
brand loyalty.

By integrating these communication strategies into your business and
branding efforts, you can effectively address the Old Brain's ingrained
tendencies while leveraging the New Brain's capacity for rational
decision-making and long-term satisfaction. Consider it aligning the
larger, instinct-driven gear of the Old Brain with the smaller,
effortful gear of the New Brain. This balanced approach enhances
customer engagement and loyalty while promoting healthier and more
sustainable consumer behaviours in today's world.

Now we turn to the final of the Big Three:

## The Privates

When I mention our "privates" or reproductive organs, it often triggers
nervous laughter or embarrassment. While these conversations may feel
awkward, the underlying instinct they represent is anything but trivial.
Reproduction is one of the most deeply embedded drives in the Old Brain,
second only to survival. When this drive is activated, it pushes the
large gear of our mental machinery into overdrive, often without
conscious input.

## The Drive to Reproduce

In *The Selfish Gene (*1976), evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins
argues that the reproductive drive is **foundational to human
behaviour.**2^ We are, he writes, "survival machines---robot vehicles
blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."
Many of our choices---around appearance, wealth, and consumption---are
unconsciously shaped by the ancient instinct to signal genetic fitness.

This drive doesn't just influence behaviour---it overrides it. When
reproductive cues are triggered, the Old Brain shifts into overdrive,
**bypassing slower, rational thought**. That's why sex, beauty, and
status remain powerful marketing triggers: they activate primal circuits
that evolved long before logic.

A vivid example can be drawn from nature: the **Peacock Effect**, where
extravagant traits signal fitness. Humans display their own plumage
through luxury items, elite credentials, or physical performance, not
solely for utility, but to project desirability, status, and vitality.

The reproductive drive goes beyond mating. The urge to leave a
legacy---through children, achievements, or creative work---is an
evolved extension of the same instinct.

Brands that understand this can create messaging that speaks to
aspiration, identity, and legacy, not just functionality. But like all
primal triggers, the Privates gear must be used ethically. Done right,
it inspires confidence and connection. Done poorly, it risks
manipulation and objectification. The key is staying aware of which
brain is turning the gears---and who's really steering.

## Modern Manifestations: Signalling and Status

In today's world, our primal drive to reproduce hasn't vanished---it's
just been rerouted through modern channels. Though we no longer compete
for mates in tribal villages, we still instinctively seek to signal our
desirability, fitness, and status. The Old Brain remains firmly in gear,
driving these behaviours, while the New Brain rationalizes them through
logic, taste, or "self-care."

These instincts show up in several key areas of consumer culture:

**- Luxury Brands:** High-end names like Rolex, Gucci, and Tesla speak
directly to the Old Brain's reproductive gear. They signal wealth,
power, and exclusivity---traits historically linked to high genetic
value. Buying them becomes a modern mating display: bold,
attention-grabbing, and intentionally costly.3^

**- Appearance-Centric Industries:** Beauty, grooming, and enhancement
sectors---cosmetic surgery, skincare, fashion, fitness---tap into deep
wiring. The Old Brain reads physical attractiveness as a sign of
reproductive health. The New Brain may call it "confidence" or
"professionalism," but underneath, instinct is at the wheel.

**- Social Media and Self-Presentation:** Platforms like Instagram,
TikTok, and LinkedIn have become digital mating arenas. Users curate
their lives, showcasing filters, followers, and lifestyle signals that
amplify attractiveness and status. It's the Peacock Effect on a
global, algorithm-fuelled scale.4^

In all of these cases, the Old Brain spins confidently, turning instinct
into action. The New Brain, meanwhile, shifts into rationalization mode,
explaining our behaviour as taste, strategy, or even necessity. But at
the core, many of these behaviours trace back to the ancient imperative
to **attract, impress, and reproduce.**

By recognizing this dynamic, brands can tap into one of the most
powerful unconscious motivators of human behaviour, while also applying
the ethical brakes when necessary. Speak to this drive too aggressively,
and you risk manipulation or alienation. But speak to it
authentically---with a blend of aspiration, identity, and value---and
you can forge a powerful and enduring emotional connection.

## Negative Emotions of the Privates

While reproductive instincts often drive attraction and ambition, they
also stir up negative emotions that shape behaviour and brand
perception:

**- Jealousy:** Rooted in the Old Brain's drive to protect
reproductive opportunities, jealousy flares when a potential mate
appears threatened by a rival. The large gear spins fast, pushing us
to guard status or connection, while the New Brain struggles to
reframe the situation calmly.

**- Envy:** Triggered by social comparison, envy reflects the fear
that someone else's traits signal higher reproductive value. It's the
Old Brain's way of flagging potential competition, nudging us to
reassess how we measure up.

Both emotions are primal signals. Brands that help ease these
tensions---by promoting self-worth, authenticity, or belonging---can
slow the Old Brain's spin and allow the New Brain to re-engage with
confidence.

**Communication Strategies for the Privates**

Grasping the significant impact of the Old Brain's reproductive
instincts enables businesses and brands to develop communication
strategies that resonate strongly with their audience. Here are some
practical approaches:

**- Highlight Status and Exclusivity:** Luxury and high-status brands
can leverage the Old Brain's desire to display superiority by
emphasizing exclusivity and prestige.

*[Example:]* Rolex consistently markets its watches as
symbols of success and prestige, appealing to consumers' desire to
showcase their achievements and status.

**- Emphasize Beauty and Attractiveness:** Brands in the beauty and
fashion industries can tap into the reproductive instincts by
promoting products that enhance physical appearance.

*[Example:]* Sephora utilizes diverse and stunning visuals
in its marketing campaigns, promoting a wide range of beauty products
that help customers enhance their appearance.

## Wrapping It Up

Understanding the Big Three Emotional Instincts---the Heart, the Gut,
and the Privates---gives us a powerful advantage: it lets us engage the
Old Brain where decisions are actually made.

When you speak the language of emotion, you're not just communicating
information; you're triggering action, anchoring memory, and forging
emotional connections that logic alone can't touch.

**This is why** the best campaigns don't just describe features---they
evoke a sense of belonging, signal safety, or hint at status and
attraction. They activate the instincts that have guided human behaviour
for millennia.

At the end of the day, we're all powered by the same core drives: to
love and be loved, to feel safe, and to find purpose. When brands align
with these instincts, they don't just persuade---they resonate. They
become part of how people see themselves.

And in a world overflowing with noise, that kind of alignment isn't just
effective---it's unforgettable.

# **Chapter 10: Leveraging Familiarity and Novelty**

**"The public's taste is not ready to accept the logical solutions to
their needs if the solution implies too vast a departure from what
they have been conditioned to accept."**

Raymond Loewy, explaining the logic behind his MAYA principle (1951)

Isn't it interesting why some new products instantly feel just right
while others leave you scratching your head? Or why do certain songs get
stuck in your head, even if they're brand new?

It's all about finding that sweet spot between what's familiar and
what's fresh. This balance ensures the Old Brain keeps turning smoothly
while introducing just enough novelty for the smaller gear to engage.
Let's dive into how understanding this balance can supercharge your
branding efforts.

## Raymond Loewy and the MAYA Principle

In the mid-twentieth century, renowned industrial designer Raymond
Loewy, famous for creating iconic designs like the Coca-Cola bottle and
the Shell logo, as well as industrial designs featuring streamlined,
rounded "egg" shaped designs such as the Greyhound bus in the 50s and
the Studebaker car in the early 60s, recognized the power of
familiarity. He referred to his approach as the MAYA
Principle1^---\"Most Advanced, Yet Acceptable"---emphasizing finding
the right balance between novelty and familiarity.

Loewy believed that people naturally resist change but still crave
something new and exciting. The secret, he said, was to **introduce
innovation in a way that feels familiar.** He argued that designs or
products should be advanced enough to spark interest but familiar enough
not to scare people away.

For brands, this means that when introducing a new product, service, or
change, it's essential to wrap it in something recognizable. If
something is too new or radically different, it can feel overwhelming or
risky to customers, causing resistance from the larger gear. But if
it's just familiar enough, it becomes approachable and exciting
simultaneously, allowing both gears to work in harmony.

*[Example:]* Coca-Cola has tweaked its branding and product
over the decades without losing the core elements that make it instantly
recognizable. The shape of the bottle, the red and white colour scheme,
and the classic logo have remained familiar, even as the brand has
evolved and added new products. This ensures the larger gear continues
to turn smoothly while allowing the smaller gear to engage with new
variations.

## Balancing Novelty and Familiarity

As explored in Chapter 4, the Old Brain thrives on familiarity---it
finds comfort in the known. But we're not just creatures of habit; we're
also wired for curiosity. The New Brain---the smaller gear---hungers for
fresh ideas, new experiences, and stimulation. That's why brands must
strike a careful balance: too much sameness, and people tune out; too
much change, and they push back. This tension plays out in everything
from product design to advertising campaigns.

The magic happens in the middle---the *sweet spot* where things feel
both fresh and familiar. It's when a brand evolves just enough to feel
current, but not so much that it alienates its loyal audience. When both
gears are turning in sync, you capture attention *and* trust.

**The Balance to Master:**

**- Too Much Novelty** → Triggers anxiety; the larger gear struggles
to engage.

**- Too Much Familiarity** → Feels stale; the smaller gear disengages.

**- Just Right** → Progress without disruption; harmony between both
gears.

*[Example:]* *Walmart's* recurring **"Rollback" pricing
events** and **seasonal aisles** follow a familiar rhythm, but always
feature new deals, displays, and limited-time products. Customers are
familiar with the format, but the changing content keeps it engaging.
This pairing of consistency and controlled novelty satisfies both brain
systems, encouraging repeated visits and emotional loyalty.

**How to Apply It:**

**- Gradual Innovation:** Introduce change in measured steps. Sudden
shifts can jolt the Old Brain's larger gear, creating resistance.
Gradual updates give customers time to adjust, keeping both gears
turning smoothly together.

**- Consistent Branding with Refreshing Touches:** Maintain
recognizable brand elements---logo, tone, values---to keep the Old
Brain anchored. Then layer in fresh creative, messaging, or
experiences to spark the New Brain's curiosity. The key is evolution,
not reinvention.

Branders, marketers, founders, and anyone running a business must
understand and appreciate the profound importance of striking a balance
between familiarity and novelty. Allow me to illustrate this point by
indulging in one of my passions---music.

## Musical Structures and Familiarity

Music uniquely engages the Old Brain through familiar structures and
emotional patterns. One of the most powerful examples is the widespread
use of limited chord progressions---particularly the **I--V--vi--IV
progression**, one of the most enduring in modern music. In the key of C
major, this translates to C--G--Am--F, a sequence that feels instantly
familiar, emotionally resonant, and deeply comforting.

This progression is so effective because it mirrors the psychological
interplay between our two gears. The I chord (C) establishes a sense of
home. The V (G) introduces tension and expectation. The vi (Am) brings a
touch of melancholy and emotional nuance, and the IV (F) resolves
everything with satisfying closure. This arc of tension and release
reflects fundamental human experiences and taps directly into the Old
Brain's craving for a predictable emotional flow---while providing the
New Brain with enough variation to stay engaged.

Unsurprisingly, this pattern shows up in #1 hits across genres and
decades. These songs feel instantly "right" because they strike the
perfect balance between what we already know and what we're just
discovering---exactly the formula we aim for in effective branding.

Here are just a few examples of #1 songs that use the I--V--vi--IV
progression:

So why does this happen so consistently, and why are alternate chord
progressions less popular? It's because we're talking (or singing) in
the comfort zone of the Old Brain.

**The lazy Old Brain thrives on familiarity and predicting outcomes.
Familiar chord progressions create a sense of predictability, allowing
listeners to anticipate the musical flow without expending excessive
cognitive effort.**

*[Example:]* Take the time to watch a YouTube clip posted by
producer Sir Mashalot titled **"Mind-Blowing SIX Song Country Mashup."**
In the video, he layers six country music chart-toppers---so precisely
that the vocals, chord changes, and even drum fills lock together as
though they were recorded for the very same song.2^ What listeners
experience is the Old Brain's love of the familiar laid bare: six
different hits collapse into a single, instantly "recognizable" hook,
proving how little novelty is required for a track to feel radio-ready.
I have played this mashup in presentations and watched heads nod in
amused disbelief---the audio makes the argument for you.

**For brands, the lesson is clear:** repetition and familiarity in
structure can create a strong emotional connection. Just as these chord
progressions bring comfort and recognition to music listeners, familiar
narrative or visual patterns can elicit trust and engagement in
branding. Recognizing the psychological impact of musical structures
provides a valuable analogy for creating fresh and grounded messages
that resonate deeply with audiences across both emotional and rational
dimensions.

**Communication Strategies that Leverage the Power of Familiarity:**

**- Incorporate Archetypes:** Choose an archetype (more in Chapter 12)
that best represents your brand and your customers. Use it in your
brand storytelling to create relatable and emotionally impactful
narratives that resonate deeply with your audience. This will also
build the brand through consistency.

*[Example:]* Pampers uses the \"Caregiver\" archetype to
position itself as a nurturing and supportive brand for parents,
resonating with their desire to provide the best care for their
children.

**- Leverage Existing Narratives:** Use established brand stories and
archetypes to create continuity in marketing campaigns. This
consistency helps maintain brand recognition and fosters a deeper
emotional connection with customers.

*[Example:]* Roots leverages its Canadian heritage narrative
across campaigns, creating a consistent and recognizable brand story.

**- Structure Content Strategically:** Align your content and
marketing strategies with well-established narrative structures to
provide a sense of order and satisfaction, enhancing engagement and
retention.

*[Example:]* Airbnb\'s content strategy uses guest stories
to provide a relatable and satisfying narrative for potential customers.

The enduring appeal of familiar songs, stories, movies, and sequels, in
particular, is intricately linked to the Old Brain's preference for
familiarity. Leveraging the principles that make them successful will
lead to more compelling engagements, ultimately driving sustained
success and loyalty.

## Consistency Builds Trust

The Old Brain craves familiarity and predictability---qualities that
make **consistency one of the most potent tools for branding and
business strategy**. Just as early humans relied on repeated patterns
and dependable cues in their environment for survival, today's audiences
gravitate toward brands they recognize and trust.

This preference is not merely emotional---it's neurological. Familiar
brand elements activate brain recognition pathways and reinforce
long-term memory neural connections. Over time, those consistent signals
become shortcuts---mental "autofill" that reduce cognitive load and
create feelings of comfort and reliability.

That's why consistency isn't dull. **It's branding gold.**

While innovation and evolution are essential for growth, abrupt or
unnecessary change can disrupt this sense of familiarity. It can confuse
the Old Brain, trigger uncertainty, and even erase **the memory
capital** your brand has worked hard to build.

So, please **don't change your logo** unless you absolutely must.

When we take on a new branding client, one of the first things they
often want to do is change everything, especially the logo and tagline.
When we ask why, the usual answer is, "It's time for a change." That's a
big mistake.

If your logo has been around long enough to build recognition and brand
equity, why throw that away? Your customers have stored that image in
the Old Brain's **long-term memory**, associating it with your service,
product, or promise. A complete overhaul can create unnecessary
dissonance. *Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.* In many
cases, a **thoughtful brand refresh**---subtle updates to typography,
colour, or layout---is all that's needed to modernize without starting
over.

**Remember: consistency builds trust** in your customer's mind, and
trust drives loyalty. Break that pattern too abruptly, and you risk
having to rebuild brand memory from scratch.

## Repetition Locks It In

If consistency lays the foundation, **repetition is the tool that
solidifies your brand in memory**.

The New Brain holds short-term memory---the mental notepad where your
message lands. But unless it's repeated and emotionally reinforced, that
message fades quickly. **Long-term memory resides in the Old Brain;
repetition is how it is formed**.

This is why effective branding, communication, and storytelling rely on
strategic redundancy. Repetition strengthens neural pathways. It makes
your message more familiar, trusted, and easier to recall, especially
when paired with visual or emotional cues.

Think of every slogan you remember effortlessly. I bet you can identify
these brands:

- "Just do it."

- "The quicker picker-upper."

- "I'm lovin' it."

- "Finger lickin' good."

- "Melts in your mouth, not in your hands."

You didn't just memorize them---you absorbed them through **sheer
exposure.**

Repetition also has an emotional dimension. The more we hear or see
something, the more we like it---a phenomenon known as the **mere
exposure effect**. The Old Brain interprets repetition as a signal of
safety and reliability, making us more likely to choose that brand,
product, or idea when it matters most.

But don't confuse strategic repetition with lazy duplication. Great
messaging varies the phrasing, tone, or medium while reinforcing the
same core idea. That's how you **train the brain to remember you,
without tuning you out.**

In short, **consistency keeps you familiar. Repetition makes you
unforgettable.**

## The Pitfalls of Excessive Change

While brands must evolve to stay relevant, too much change can alienate
them. Abrupt branding shifts can disrupt consumers\' emotional
connection with the brand, causing confusion, frustration, and a loss of
loyalty. The Old Brain perceives drastic changes as potential threats,
triggering defensive behaviours that can harm the brand\'s reputation
and financial standing.

A great example of the pitfalls of excessive change in branding is
Tropicana's approximate \$65 million mistake.

*[Example:]* In 2009, Tropicana launched a major packaging
redesign, replacing its familiar orange-and-straw image with a sleek,
modern look. The overhaul included a new logo, new colours, and a
redesigned carton---abandoning decades of visual equity. According to
*The New York Times*, the company spent over \$35 million on the
redesign and launch.3^ Consumers reacted poorly. In less than two
months, *Ad Age* reported a 19% drop in sales---about \$33
million---forcing Tropicana to revert to the original design.4^ The
lesson: sudden, excessive change can backfire when it breaks trust with
the Old Brain's preference for familiarity.

**Lesson Learned:** Tropicana's experience demonstrates the importance
of maintaining consistency in branding. The Old Brain's preference for
familiar and comforting elements was not honoured, failing to connect
with consumers and resulting in lost brand loyalty.

**Communication Strategies for Consistency over Change**

1\. **Maintain Core Brand Elements:** Ensure that the fundamental
elements of your brand, such as the logo, colour scheme, and messaging,
remain consistent over time to foster recognition and trust.

**- Consistency in Visual Identity:** Maintain consistency in your
logo and colour palette across all platforms and marketing materials.

**- Uniform Messaging:** Develop a consistent tone and message that
reflects your brand's values and mission.

**- Avoid Radical Changes:** Implement gradual updates rather than
complete overhauls to maintain familiarity.

2\. **Incremental Evolution:** Introduce changes gradually to allow
consumers to adapt without feeling overwhelmed or alienated.

**- Small Tweaks:** Implement minor adjustments to packaging, product
lines, or marketing campaigns, rather than undertaking significant
redesigns.

**- Feedback Loops:** Engage with customers to gather feedback on
proposed changes and adjust accordingly.

**- Phased Rollouts:** Implement changes in stages, testing consumer
reactions before a full-scale launch.

3\. **Leverage Nostalgia and Familiarity:** Use nostalgic elements and
familiar themes to evoke positive emotions and reinforce the connection
with your brand.

**- Retro Designs:** Incorporate retro or classic design elements in
your branding to remind customers of the brand's history.

**- Storytelling:** Share the brand's origin stories and heritage in
marketing communications to reinforce a sense of continuity and
authenticity.

**- Consistency in Campaigns:** Use familiar slogans and imagery that
customers associate with positive experiences.

## Wrapping It Up

Understanding the Old Brain's deep preference for **familiarity and
simplicity** sheds light on why specific musical structures, story arcs,
and brand messages consistently capture our attention. The secret? It's
not about reinventing the wheel---it's about making that wheel feel just
different enough to be exciting, without losing the **grip of what's
already stored in memory**.

What we often perceive as "fresh" or "innovative" is frequently just a
clever remix of the familiar. Great ideas---the ones that
*stick*---aren't typically built from scratch. Instead, they fuse
tried-and-true patterns with just the right twist of novelty. That's
where real magic happens: in the subtle tension between what we expect
and what surprises us. **The familiar pattern ensures recognition and
recall; the novelty ensures engagement.**

In branding and business, this balance isn't just artistic---it's
strategic. The Old Brain gravitates toward comfort and recognition. The
New Brain seeks stimulation and progression. When your brand speaks
fluently to both and activates long-term memory while offering a fresh
take, you turn both gears in harmony and unlock a deeper, more lasting
connection.

In a world that's constantly shifting, people seek comfort in what they
know---but they also crave the spark of something new. **A strong brand
becomes a memory anchor in a sea of noise**, offering both stability and
excitement. By blending both, you meet your audience where they are and
guide them somewhere even better---even if they don't yet realize that's
where they want to go.

Remember, your brand is a story unfolding. Make it one they can't wait
to remember---and return to.

How do we tell that story? Turn the page!

# **Chapter 11: Storytelling**

**"Those who tell the stories rule the world."**

Plato

Over the years, I've opened countless client meetings, presentations and
workshops with a story from my early days in the industry --- a story
that always gets people leaning in.

I grew up in Timmins, Ontario ---a small mining town where everybody
seemed to know everybody. I loved music, played in a local band, and
started working as a DJ at our local radio station. I also ran a small
home studio on the side. I rented it out to local artists and produced
jingles for small businesses in the area. One of the aspiring musicians
who came through was a young woman named Eileen. She didn't have much
money, so instead of paying cash, she would sing on the jingles I wrote
--- trading her voice for studio time to record her own demo songs.

At the time, no one could have predicted how her story would unfold. But
those early demos eventually gained traction with record companies. Not
long after, Eileen reinvented herself as **Shania Twain** and became one
of the best-selling female artists in music history.

I love sharing that story because it proves a point: **a good story
captures attention immediately**. Before the data, before the analysis,
it's the story that hooks people emotionally. When I tell it, rooms full
of marketers, entrepreneurs, and executives instantly sit up and tune in
--- not because of a slide deck, but because a human story taps into
something more profound.

In the high-stakes arenas of branding, marketing, and leadership, this
principle holds absolute power: facts might inform the New Brain, but
it\'s *stories* that seize the Old Brain and truly move people. A
well-told narrative doesn\'t just make an idea memorable; it forges an
**emotional investment**, building a connection so robust that it can
withstand the relentless barrage of data in our modern world.

We are, at our core, storytelling creatures. This isn\'t a recent
development; it\'s etched into our evolutionary DNA. From the earliest
cave paintings to today\'s viral TikToks, we\'ve relied on narrative to
communicate, to bond, to make sense of the chaos and find meaning. Why?
Because stories **speak the Old Brain\'s native language.** Those
familiar arcs of struggle, triumph, love, and loss---the gossip, the
character studies, the myths---these are the Old Brain\'s comfort food.
It devours them.

Indeed, **storytelling is the master lubricant that keeps our gears
moving smoothly**. More than that, exceptional storytelling is the most
direct and potent direct line of communication to the Old Brain. It has
the almost magical ability to set that dominant gear spinning
effortlessly, captivating our primal instincts long before the New Brain
even has a chance to ask, \"But is this logical?\"

## We are Myth-Makers

In one of my favourite books, *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
(2014)*, Yuval Noah Harari highlights a defining trait of our species:
we are myth-makers. Roughly 70,000 years ago, during what he calls the
**Cognitive Revolution**, humans gained the ability to create complex
narratives. While our Old Brain still reacts like a chimp's---focused on
survival cues---our New Brain can imagine gods, laws, nations, and
brands. These things don't exist in nature, yet they profoundly shape
our behaviour.

Harari introduces the concept of intersubjectivity1^---shared myths
that are neither purely objective nor subjective. They exist only
because large groups of people believe in them. Money, for example, is
just paper without a collective agreement. The same goes for nations,
companies, and brands.

For storytellers, marketers, and innovators, this is powerful insight.
Every logo, slogan, and mission statement is an attempt to create a
unifying myth---one that lives in the collective psyche and influences
behaviour like ancient religions or ideologies once did.

## Storytelling Structures

Storytelling structures are frameworks that guide the flow of a
narrative, helping to shape events, characters, and emotions into a
cohesive and impactful story. These structures provide the Old Brain
with the familiarity and predictability it craves while offering the New
Brain the logical sequence it needs to process and understand the
story's deeper meaning.

Whether it's the classic arc of the Hero's Journey, the simplicity of
the Three-Act Structure, or the escalating tension of the Mountain
Structure, these frameworks resonate because they mirror the way humans
naturally experience and interpret the world. They simplify complex
ideas and provide a sense of order, making stories easier to follow and
more emotionally engaging.

**The beauty of storytelling structures lies in their adaptability. They
serve as blueprints, not constraints, allowing storytellers to align
their narratives with specific goals and audiences.**

These structures combine familiar patterns with emotional triggers,
guiding the Old and New Brain through a narrative journey that informs,
inspires, and persuades. When used effectively, storytelling structures
transform messages into memorable experiences, ensuring they resonate on
instinctive and intellectual levels.

Let's review some of the most common storytelling structures and how to
use them in your branding efforts.

## 1. The Hero\'s Journey

The Hero's Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell in his seminal work
The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), is a timeless storytelling
structure that resonates deeply because it mirrors universal human
experiences of challenge, growth, and transformation. Campbell describes
a narrative in which a hero leaves their ordinary world, endures trials,
encounters mentors, and returns transformed. A perfect example is Luke
Skywalker from Star Wars.

At its core, the Hero's Journey2^ appeals to the Old Brain by evoking
primal emotions---fear, hope, courage, and reward--- while satisfying
the New Brain's need for logical progression and resolution. Brands
often use this structure to position customers as the hero, with their
product or service as the mentor guiding them toward success. This dual
engagement of the emotional and rational mind makes the Hero's Journey
one of the most effective tools for storytelling, branding, and
connection.

Crafting your brand stories around the Hero's Journey is extremely
powerful. Often, you can make the customer the "hero" and your product
or service the "mentor" that enables them to grow and develop new
skills.

*[Example:]* A first-time founder sets out to disrupt their
industry but quickly runs into funding hurdles, hiring missteps, and
product-market confusion. Just as self-doubt creeps in, they discover
your platform, offering expert guidance, tools, and a community of
fellow builders. With your support, they refine their pitch, gain
traction, and launch a startup that finally turns heads.

**Why It Works:** The Hero's Journey taps into a timeless narrative
pattern hardwired into the Old Brain. By positioning your customer as
the hero and your brand as the trusted guide, this structure builds
emotional resonance, trust, and loyalty. It doesn't just show what you
offer---it shows how you *transform* lives.

## 2. The Three-Act Structure

The Three-Act Structure, rooted in classical drama, divides a story into
three parts:

**1. Set up:** Introduce the characters, setting, and conflict.

**2. Confrontation:** The main character faces challenges or
obstacles.

**3. Resolution:** The conflict is resolved, and the protagonist's
journey concludes.

This structure is universally appealing because it mirrors how we
naturally experience and interpret life: beginning, middle, and end.

*[Example:]*

*[Setup:]* A family struggles with clutter (problem
identified).

*[Confrontation:]* They try different solutions, none of
which work (challenges).

*[Resolution:]* They discover an innovative storage system
(your product) that transforms their home and brings peace.

**Why It Works:** The Three-Act Structure is intuitive and
straightforward, satisfying the Old Brain's desire for resolution while
giving the New Brain clear, logical progression.

## 3. The Mountain Structure

As the story progresses, this framework builds tension and stakes,
culminating in a climactic peak followed by a resolution. Unlike the
Hero's Journey, which involves cycles of challenge and recovery, the
Mountain Structure focuses on continuous escalation.

**Key Elements:**

- Gradual build-up of conflict or stakes.

- A climax that serves as the emotional high point.

- A resolution that provides closure.

*[Example:]* A small business starts with high hopes,
encounters mounting challenges (e.g., competition, resource shortages),
but ultimately finds success through your mentorship or service.

**Why It Works:** The Mountain Structure mirrors real-life struggles,
creating a sense of urgency and emotional investment that resonates with
audiences.

## 4. The Pixar Framework

The Pixar Framework3^ is a simple yet powerful storytelling structure
that creates emotionally resonant and logically satisfying narratives.
Its formula is simple:

**1. Once upon a time**... *(Setting the stage)*

**2. Every day**... *(Establishing normalcy)*

**3. Until one day**... *(Inciting incident)*

**4. Because of that**... *(Escalation of stakes)*

**5. Until finally**... *(Climax and resolution)*

**6. And ever since then**... *(New normal)*

This structure engages the Old Brain through relatable characters and
escalating stakes, while providing the New Brain with clear
cause-and-effect logic.

*[Example:]* "Once upon a time, Jane struggled with fitness.
Every day, she tried new diets and workouts, but nothing worked. Until
one day, she discovered our personalized coaching app. Because of that,
she built habits that stuck until she finally reached her goals. And
ever since then, she's never felt healthier or happier."

**Why It Works:** This structure appeals to the Old and New Brain by
combining emotional engagement with clear cause-and-effect logic.

## 5. Sequels

Do you know how many James Bond movies have been made? How many actors
have played James Bond? Well, if you answered twenty-five and six, you
are correct. And they are more popular now than ever. How can this be?

Sequels and franchises are particularly effective at engaging the Old
Brain because they lean into familiarity. When audiences encounter a
sequel, they engage with characters, plots, and worlds they are already
familiar with. This familiarity allows the Old Brain to effortlessly
process the story---the large gear turns easily without requiring much
input from the smaller rational gear.

**Sequels often become franchises that expand beyond the movies to
merchandise, books, conventions, user groups, music, and so much more.
This is all because of the power of familiarity with the Old Brain.**

Sequels build upon established narratives, characters, and settings that
audiences have already grown accustomed to. This familiarity aligns
perfectly with the Old Brain's preference for predictable and
recognizable patterns.

**- Reduced Cognitive Load:** The Old Brain thrives on recognizing
patterns and minimizing uncertainty. By continuing a story with
familiar elements, sequels enable the Old Brain to process information
effortlessly, enhancing enjoyment without demanding substantial mental
effort.

**- Emotional Comfort:** Familiar characters and settings provide a
sense of emotional security. Audiences feel comfortable revisiting
beloved stories, as the known elements evoke positive emotions and
reduce the anxiety associated with encountering the unknown.

*[Example:]* The Marvel Cinematic Universe: Each movie
introduces new elements while staying true to the overarching storyline
and character development.

## Wrapping It Up

Whether we're painting caves or scrolling through social media,
storytelling is at the core of being human. We use it to unite tribes,
rally around ideals, and make sense of a changing world---feeding the
Old Brain's need for emotion and the New Brain's desire for meaning.

That's why storytelling is such an effective oil for the gears of our
Divided Brain: it captures the fast, reactive Old Brain while satisfying
the slower, reflective New Brain in one smooth motion. A great story
doesn't just entertain---it shifts us between impulse and insight.

Yuval Noah Harari's insight---that humans are myth-makers---highlights
how shared narratives shape both civilizations and brands. A strong
story speaks to the Old Brain's craving for identity and belonging,
while offering the New Brain structure, logic, and something larger to
believe in.

Storytelling also works on a neurological level. As we explored in
Chapter 8, it releases dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin, creating
anticipation, empathy, and emotional resolution. Formats like the Hero's
Journey or Three-Act Structure mirror the Old Brain's love of rhythm
while guiding the New Brain through a purposeful arc.

As you craft your brand's story---or any story---remember: **you hold
the keys to both brains.** Lead with emotion to engage the Old Brain,
and follow with structure to earn the New Brain's trust. That's how you
shift your audience from passive attention to active movement.

Because in the end, we're not just consumers of stories---we're the ones
who shape them.

Now, let's explore one of the most powerful tools for storytelling:
Archetypes.

# **Chapter 12: Archetypes**

**"Archetypes give brands a heartbeat, conveying meanings people
instinctively grasp across cultures and generations."**

Margaret Mark & Carol S. Pearson, The Hero and the Outlaw (2001)

**Your brand is defined by what your customers say about it---so the
real question is: Who are you, in their eyes?**

Archetypes, deeply rooted in psychology, are universally familiar
character types that transcend time, place, culture, gender, and age.
They're hardwired into our psyche, instantly recognizable to our Old
Brain because we've carried them in our collective unconscious for
millennia. We don't have to learn them from scratch; we feel them
instinctively whenever we encounter a familiar character pattern.

In the early 20th century, the famous psychiatrist **Carl Jung**
introduced the concept of archetypes as a core component of his theory
of the **collective unconscious**.1^ He recognized these enduring
themes and motifs as powerful drivers of human thought, emotion, and
behaviour. Subsequent generations of scholars have taken Jung's
foundational ideas and developed practical frameworks for applying
archetypes in domains such as storytelling, branding, and organizational
psychology. This makes them not just theoretical constructs but working
tools to help shape and communicate your brand's unique identity.

Consider Joseph Campbell's *Hero's Journey*, which was mentioned
earlier. This narrative template resonates so deeply because it's packed
with archetypes and predictable patterns that the Old Brain craves. It's
not simply a storytelling device; it's a psychological comfort zone,
which we know the Old Brain loves. Archetypes provide a sense of order
and familiarity that helps people navigate complexity. When a story or
brand embraces these universal characters, it aligns with something
primal and reassuring in our minds.

Archetypes also exert a profound influence on customer motivation. They
infuse **intangible meaning and integrity** into your brand, forging an
emotional bond that New Brain logical features alone can't achieve.

At our organization, we always assist our clients in identifying their
primary and secondary archetypes and devising strategies to leverage
their potential. This is akin to uncovering the **secret ingredient**
that renders their brand exceptional.

## Connecting to the Old Brain

Archetypes speak the language of the Old Brain. They cater to its
preference for simplicity, familiarity, and consistency---qualities it
instinctively trusts. When a brand constantly shifts its persona or
messaging, the Old Brain doesn't try to decode the inconsistency---it
simply tunes it out. But when a brand consistently embodies a clear
archetype, it sends a strong, recognizable signal that cuts through the
noise and engages the Old Brain effortlessly.

Choosing one or two archetypes that genuinely reflect your company's
core values and resonate with your audience's expectations ensures your
brand communicates on a deeper, more instinctive level. Archetypes act
as your brand's **internal compass.** They don't just influence
campaigns; they provide a **steady gear alignment**, ensuring every
interaction runs smoothly and predictably.

Properly applied, archetypes help resolve brand inconsistencies by
becoming your brand's DNA---a hidden code that ensures alignment between
who you are and how you're perceived. Instead of shifting tone or
identity with each new campaign, you maintain a coherent presence that
the Old Brain can recognize, trust, and act upon. This consistency
allows both gears to stay in sync, with the Old Brain feeling secure and
the New Brain seeing strategic clarity.

## Evolving Archetypes

That said, some global brands shift their archetypes as they evolve and
redefine their market position. Apple is a perfect example. In the early
1980s, as the underdog taking on IBM and Microsoft, they adopted an
Outlaw archetype. Think back (if you're old enough) to their iconic
1984 Apple Macintosh launch spot during the Super Bowl---a bold,
cinematic nod to George Orwell's dystopia that cast Apple as the
fearless rebel shaking up a grey, homogenized world.

In the 1990s, Apple shifted toward the Creator archetype. The Think
Different campaign highlighted icons like Picasso, Lennon, and Muhammad
Ali, positioning Apple as a brand for imaginative, world-changing
thinkers.

When Steve Jobs returned, Apple evolved again---this time into the
Magician. In the 2000s, their product reveals felt like modern magic
acts. Whether it was "1,000 songs in your pocket" with the iPod or
pulling a MacBook Air from a manila envelope, Apple didn't just
innovate---they enchanted.

Today, Apple reflects the Ruler archetype. As the most valuable
company in the world, it leads entire industries---such as smartphones,
retail, music, and more---with confidence and authority.

Apple's archetypal journey mirrors its evolution---from rebellious
challenger to visionary leader. These shifts aren't just
branding---they're strategic narrative tools that deepen connection and
meaning over time.

If you want a roadmap for applying archetypes in your brand, Margaret
Mark and Carol Pearson's *The Hero and The Outlaw* (2001) is essential
reading. They offer a clear, practical framework based on twelve
timeless archetypes that speak directly to the human psyche. Used well,
these patterns don't just help brands stand out---they help them *feel*
instantly familiar and emotionally resonant.

Next, we'll explore those twelve archetypes and help you find the one
that best aligns with your brand's story.

## The Archetypes

The twelve archetypes2^ are grouped into four motivational categories.
Let's explore each category and its corresponding archetypes.

## Stability and Control Archetypes

**1. Creator**

**2. Caregiver**

**3. Ruler**

The motivations for these archetypes are:

**- Customer fears (pains):** Chaos, ruin, decline, ill health.

-Helps people feel safe and in control. Structure.

## 1. Creator

**- Promise:** Imagination.

**- Motto:** If you can imagine it, it can be done.

**- AKA:** The artist, inventor, innovator, musician, writer or
dreamer.

**- Creator brands:** YouTube, Pinterest, Adobe, LEGO, Crayola, Apple
(late 90s), Home Depot.

The Creator archetype channels the power of imagination, artistry, and
bold vision. It's all about self-expression, pushing boundaries, and
bringing something new and inspiring into the world. Creator brands feel
like artists excitedly sketching possibilities, dreamers shaping the
future, and innovators daring to reinvent what we know. They remind us
that we are not just consumers of reality but also its architects, free
to design and redesign at will.

[Example:] Home Depot, although counterintuitive, is a
Creator archetype. They help you bring your vision (new kitchen, deck)
to life.

## 2. Caregiver

**- Promise:** To Help Others.

**- Motto:** Love your neighbour as yourself.

**- AKA:** The protector, saint, altruist, parent, helper, supporter,
humanitarian.

**- Caregiver brands:** Salvation Army, Shopper's Drug Mart,
Hospitals, Hospices, and Volvo.

The Caregiver, sometimes referred to as the nurturer archetype, is
characterized by an abundance of care, compassion, and a deep commitment
to protect and comfort. These brands see it as their mission to
anticipate needs, solve problems, and make people feel safe and
supported. Like a caregiver who blankets you in reassurance and warmth,
Caregiver brands say, *"We've got you."* They transform challenging
moments into opportunities for healing, kindness, and growth, and their
presence makes the world feel more secure and humane.

[Example:] Johnson & Johnson, with its gentle products and
reassuring tone, makes you feel comforted, cared for, and truly at home.

## 3. Ruler

**- Promise:** Power.

**- Motto:** Power isn\'t everything; it\'s the only thing.

**- AKA:** The boss, leader, aristocrat, king, queen, politician, role
model, manager or administrator.

- **Ruler brands:** Microsoft, Apple (current day), Mercedes, Rolex,
Cadillac.

The Ruler archetype embodies authority, leadership, and a confident
presence in the landscape. These brands set standards, define goals, and
organize the world to their liking. They provide structure and clarity,
inspiring respect through their ability to impose order and achieve
ambitious results. Connecting with a Ruler brand feels like standing
behind a capable leader who guides everyone toward success, stability,
and meaningful progress.

*[Example:]* Mercedes-Benz, known for its prestige,
excellence, and engineering mastery, sets the rules on the road.

## Belonging & Enjoyment Archetypes

**4. Jester**

**5. Regular Guy/Gal**

**6. Lover**

The motivations for these archetypes are:

**- Customer fears (pains):** Exile, orphaned, abandonment.

-Helps people feel love and a sense of community.

## 4. Jester

**- Promise:** Have a laugh.

**- Motto:** You only live once.

**- AKA:** Silly, trickster, joker, practical joker or comedian.

**- Jester brands:** M&Ms, Old Spice (Smell like a man), Koodo.

The Jester archetype brings the party. This is the friend who cracks
jokes, lightens the mood, and reminds you not to take everything so
seriously. Jester brands introduce playfulness and spontaneity, making
it okay to laugh, relax, and let go for a moment. They value humour as a
way to connect, share joy, and find common ground. Interacting with a
Jester brand feels like being in on a clever joke or discovering the
funny side of life's everyday quirks.

[Example:] M&M's, with its cheeky animated characters and
witty humour, makes even a candy break a playful event.

## Wrapping It Up

Archetypes empower you to connect with your audience on a fundamental,
deeply intuitive level. They provide a blueprint for authenticity,
resonating with the Old Brain's craving for the familiar and meaningful,
while giving the New Brain the structure and rationale it needs to buy
in. When used wisely, archetypes serve as the consistency glue for your
brand, keeping your message smooth and steady as the world around you
shifts.

By aligning with archetypes that reflect your values and customers'
expectations, you build a brand personality that holds true through
complexity and change. This isn't about slapping on a character
mask---it's about uncovering your brand's core identity and expressing
it consistently across every touchpoint. Done well, archetypes help you
craft a narrative people actually care about---one that sparks
recognition, earns trust, and inspires loyalty.

Whether your brand embodies the wisdom of the Sage, the courage of the
Hero, or the charm of the Jester, you're tapping into a universal
emotional shorthand. Archetypes are more than storytelling
devices---they're strategic anchors. As Margaret Mark and Carol
Pearson's work demonstrates, archetypes can guide everything from
messaging and product design to internal culture and long-term growth.

Embrace them, and you'll find it easier to tell a story that resonates,
build an aligned culture, and create experiences that endure.

Now that you've discovered how archetypes anchor your brand's identity
and speak directly to the Old Brain, the next step is learning how to
gently guide behaviour without triggering resistance. That's where
nudging comes in.

If archetypes are your brand's personality, nudges are how that
personality moves through the world. Let's dive in.

# **Chapter 13: Nudging**

**"If you want to encourage people to do something, make it easy."**

Richard H. Thaler, Nobel‑prize economist

**What is Nudging?**

Nudging1^ is the art and science of subtly steering people toward
certain choices---without taking away their freedom. Think of it as
building a decision environment (what researchers call *choice
architecture*) that encourages better outcomes by making helpful options
easier or more appealing, while still keeping all options on the table.

This idea gained global attention through Richard Thaler and Cass
Sunstein's groundbreaking book *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health,
Wealth, and Happiness* (2008), and has since become a cornerstone of
behavioural economics, marketing, psychology, and public policy.

A nudge isn't a shove---it's more like a tap on the shoulder. Imagine
placing healthy snacks at eye level, or labelling a product as "most
popular." You're not restricting choices; you're simply shaping the
environment to favour a particular path. The Old Brain notices these
cues---effortlessly turning its larger gear in response---while the New
Brain remains free to engage or override. The person is still driving
the car... you've just suggested which gear might work best.

## Why Nudging Works

As we've seen throughout this book, the Old Brain relies heavily on
mental shortcuts to manage complexity---biases like *loss aversion*,
*social proof*, and *anchoring*. Nudging works not by overpowering these
tendencies, but by aligning with them. It gently guides behaviour in a
direction that both gears can support.

**Nudging is another tool to help us shift gears manually**, easing the
transition from autopilot to awareness without grinding the system. It
bridges reflex and reason.

**Core principles of nudging:**

**- Ease & Convenience:** Make the preferred action simpler or more
accessible.

**- Cognitive Alignment:** Utilize known biases to your advantage,
rather than against them.

**- Preserved Autonomy:** Keep all choices available---nudging isn't
coercion.

**- Subtlety Over Force:** Quietly guide instead of loudly commanding.

## Nudging the small gear in branding and business

The New Brain's smaller gear may not have the raw momentum of the Old
Brain's larger gear, but it does have a powerful tool we've covered in
detail: metacognition. By creating environments that align with our
natural biases and heuristics, we can allow the New Brain to gently
press the clutch, engage metacognition, and nudge the system in a more
beneficial direction.

In branding and business, this means building "choice architecture" that
subtly steers decisions---placing helpful defaults, highlighting social
proof, or simplifying desired actions. These cues don't overpower the
Old Brain; they work with it, guiding its motion rather than trying to
stop it.

## Nudging as a Transformative Tool

The beauty of nudging lies in its versatility. It's not just about
changing consumer behaviour; it's a framework that can be applied across
diverse domains:

**- Public Policy:** Governments use nudges to encourage positive
actions, such as saving for retirement, reducing energy consumption,
or increasing vaccination rates.

**- Healthcare:** Subtle changes, such as sending reminders for
medical appointments or making healthier options more visible in
cafeterias, can promote better health choices.

**- Education:** Schools can design environments that encourage
students to pick up books or engage in learning activities by making
those activities more accessible or visually appealing.

There are several ways brands and businesses can incorporate nudging
principles, primarily using our understanding of heuristics and
cognitive biases:

## Product labelling and positioning

- Highlighting key product attributes with labels like \"bestseller\"
or \"eco-friendly".

- Placing healthier food options at eye level in stores.

- Using colour psychology in packaging design.

## Pricing strategies

- Price anchoring by showing original prices crossed out next to sale
prices.

- Creative pricing to make specific options seem more attractive.

- Bundling products to increase perceived value.

## Social proof

- Displaying customer reviews and ratings prominently.

- Showing real-time notifications of other customers\' actions.

- Using influencer endorsements.

## Default options

- Pre-selecting the most popular or profitable option.

- Making opt-in the default for email subscriptions.

- Setting automatic renewals as the default for subscriptions.

## Scarcity and urgency

- Showing limited stock availability.

- Using countdown timers for sales and offers.

- Displaying \"X people are viewing this item\" notifications.

## Personalization

- Tailoring product recommendations based on browsing history.

- Addressing customers by name in communications.

- Customizing offers based on past purchase behaviour.

## Framing

- Positioning products/services in terms of benefits rather than
features.

- Framing prices in daily rather than monthly terms (e.g. \"just \$1
per day").

- Using loss aversion by emphasizing what customers might miss out on.

**The Ethical Dimension of Nudging**

While nudging is a powerful tool, it must be wielded with care. Poorly
designed or exploitative nudges risk eroding trust, alienating
consumers, or perpetuating inequities. Ethical nudging requires
transparency, respect for individual autonomy, and alignment with the
broader well-being of the individuals being nudged.

In Canada, where cultural diversity and regional values play a
significant role in shaping public perceptions, nudging must also be
sensitive to these contexts. A nudge that works well in urban Toronto
may not resonate in rural Saskatchewan or northern Indigenous
communities. Customizing nudges to reflect **local values and
priorities** is critical to ensuring their effectiveness and ethical
soundness.

**When implementing nudging techniques, it\'s essential to consider:**

**- Transparency:** Communicate the intention behind the nudge to
consumers, avoiding any sense of manipulation.

**- Cultural Sensitivity:** Tailor nudges to reflect the values and
priorities of specific communities.

**- Empowerment:** Use nudges to guide individuals toward better
outcomes that align with their own goals and values, rather than
simply benefiting the organization implementing them.

- Use nudges to enhance the customer experience, not manipulate.

By thoughtfully incorporating nudging principles, brands can guide
customers toward desired actions while still allowing them to feel in
control of their choices. This can lead to increased conversions,
customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty.

## Wrapping It Up

Nudging is the art of gently steering behaviour, not by restricting
options but by designing environments that make the right choice the
easier one. It's a subtle yet powerful way to balance the Old Brain's
instinctive momentum with the New Brain's rational intent. Like a
well-timed clutch shift, nudging helps engage the smaller gear without
stalling the larger one.

When done thoughtfully, nudging enhances the customer experience,
fosters trust, and builds lasting brand loyalty. It allows us to
influence without imposing, to guide without coercion. By respecting the
balance between autonomy and influence, nudging empowers people to make
better decisions while ensuring they still feel in control.

For branders, founders, and marketers, the challenge---and
opportunity---is clear: design your brand interactions so they work
*with* human nature, not against it. When you nudge ethically, you don't
just increase conversions---you build meaningful connections that stand
the test of time.

Nudging shows us how small shifts in perception can spark significant
changes in behaviour---without force, without friction. But how do you
design an entire brand around these insights? How do you create a clear,
consistent message that nudges both gears toward trust, value, and
action?

In the next chapter, we shift into manual and lay out the ultimate
framework: **The Brand Value Canvas**. It's your blueprint for syncing
strategy with psychology, ensuring your brand doesn't just get noticed,
but gets remembered.

1\. The concept of nudging, as applied here, is adapted from Richard H.
Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health,
Wealth, and Happiness* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008).

# **Chapter 14: Brand Value Canvas**

**"People do not buy goods and services. They buy relations, stories,
and magic."**

Seth Godin, All Marketers Are Liars (2005)

## Applying the Divided Brain to Your Brand

At this point, you might be wondering:

**"Okay, I get it. I now understand how people think and choose. But how
do I actually apply this to my brand, startup, or business?"**

You're in the right place.

You've seen how the Old Brain and New Brain shape every choice we make.
But insight alone won't move the needle---what matters is how you
*apply* that understanding to create a brand that resonates, connects,
and converts.

That's where the **Brand Value Canvas** comes in. It's a hands-on
framework that brings the Divided Brain metaphor to life. It helps you
clarify and distill your **Brand Promise**---the single, unshakable idea
you **want to own in your customer's mind.** This isn't just about
positioning or messaging. It's about aligning your brand with the core
emotional and rational triggers that drive behaviour. And what do I mean
by brand value?

## Value Is Perceived, Not Measured

In marketing, "value" isn't determined solely by utility or cost---it's
a story we tell ourselves. As Vice-Chairman of Ogilvy UK, Rory
Sutherland often argues that **perception usually trumps objective
reality.**1^ A product's actual function may remain constant, but our
experience of it can be dramatically altered by branding, context,
design, or even the story we associate with it.

Consider how coffee in a plain white styrofoam cup tastes different from
the same coffee served in a sleek, ceramic mug. Or how paying \$6 for a
bottle of water at a luxury hotel feels acceptable, while the same water
at a gas station might seem overpriced. In each case, the actual product
remains unchanged, but the perceived value has shifted.

This is why branding is not window dressing. It's a framing device that
shapes how people experience your offer.

The **Brand Value Canvas** is built on this foundation: that *real
value* lives in the overlap between what you offer and what your
audience finds meaningful, distinctive, and worth noticing.

## What Is Your Brand Promise?

Also known as your value proposition or unique selling proposition, your
**Brand Promise** is the mental shortcut that tells people why they
should choose you. It's the first message that engages their emotional
instincts and the last thing they recall before making a decision. A
strong Brand Promise shifts your audience into gear, starting with the
Old Brain and then syncing with the New.

To truly move someone, your promise must include all three of these
components:

**1.** **Emotional Resonance (Old Brain)**

We know the Old Brain responds first. Your promise must **spark
feelings**---security, admiration, confidence, inclusion, empowerment.
Emotion is what grabs attention and gets the large gear turning. Without
it, the rest of the system comes to a halt.

**2. Rational Validation (New Brain)**

Once the Old Brain is engaged, the New Brain steps in. This is where
logic, evidence, and reassurance come into play---features,
testimonials, guarantees, or specifications. These help the smaller gear
catch and turn smoothly, allowing the mind to justify what the heart
already wants.

3\. **Distinctive Uniqueness (New/Old Brain)**

To stand out, your promise must clearly demonstrate what sets you apart
from the competition. Whether it's a unique experience, innovation, or
market positioning, differentiation ensures your brand doesn't get lost
in the noise. If it's challenging to differentiate in our
hyper-competitive world, your second option can be *to claim a specific
benefit or idea first*; you lodge it in the Old Brain's memory before
competitors even arrive. We'll explore this principle of first-to-mind
positioning in more depth shortly. For now, consider it a way to keep
your brand's transmission running smoothly and prevent emotional energy
from slipping into neutral due to confusion with lookalike brands.

Brand Promise Stool

When you bring together *emotion, logic, and differentiation*, you
create a balanced and persuasive foundation---like a three-legged stool.
Remove one leg, and the whole structure becomes unstable.

Your Brand Promise should be **clear, concise, and
compelling**---ideally just one sentence or even a few words. While it
doesn't need to be your public-facing tagline, it should guide your
positioning, messaging, and internal alignment at every turn.

## How the Brand Value Canvas Guides You

In the section that follows, you'll learn how to fill out each quadrant
of the Canvas:

**- Customer Insights**: Pinpoint Needs, Pains, and Desires to uncover
the emotional triggers and rational requirements that matter most.

**- Brand Responses**: Translate those insights into tangible
Solutions, Pain Relievers, and Rewards---your promise in action.

**- Differentiation**: Evaluate each promise point for uniqueness,
ensuring you stand out in a crowded market.

**Following these steps will crystallize a Brand Promise that cuts
through the noise---something your customers will instantly recognize
and readily defend.**

You'll be able to create brand messaging that:

**- Feels right to the gut and heart** (Old Brain).

**- Makes sense to the mind** (New Brain).

**- Stands out from the crowd** (Differentiation).

The following two pages illustrate two versions of the Brand Value
Canvas. The first is a print version that you can download
([paullarche.com/resources/](http://paullarche.com/resources/)) or
replicate. It is designed for use in a workshop environment with
employees and stakeholders. The second version is available through our
online app
([paullarche.com/brandvaluecanvas](http://paullarche.com/brandvaluecanvas)),
which is free to use. This may be more convenient if you fill it out
yourself. All instructions are available on the app by clicking the "?"
icon. You can print or save your results.

## Instructions for Using This Canvas in Workshop

**Preparation:**

- Replicate a large-scale version of the canvas. A PDF can be
downloaded at
[paullarche.com/resources/](http://paullarche.com/resources/)

- Gather sticky notes, markers, and pens.

- Invite relevant employees, stakeholders, and, ideally, customers.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

## Step 1: Understanding Your Customer

This first phase is about discovery. Each participant contributes
insights by writing sticky notes under the following sections:

**- Needs (Rational/Tangible):** What specific objectives, goals, or
problems does your customer want to achieve by buying your product or
service? Write one need per sticky note.

**- Pains (Rational and Emotional):** What frustrations, concerns,
fears, or costs (time, money, energy) affect your customers? Record
each pain individually and **rank them in order of relevance**.

**- Desires (Emotional/Intangible):** What hidden emotional
drivers---such as aspirations, identity, or connection---motivate your
audience? Capture each desire on a sticky note and **rank them in
order of emotional importance**.

**Timing:** Allow 15 minutes for individual brainstorming. Then do the
following:

1\. Have participants place their sticky notes in the respective
customer sections.

2\. The facilitator consolidates overlapping or duplicate ideas.

3\. As a group, agree on the top 3--5 insights in each category and
place them in ranked order.

## Step 2: Your Brand\'s Response

In this phase, the team maps your brand's response to the customer
insights.

Each participant writes sticky notes for:

**- Solutions:** How does your brand meet each customer's rational
needs? What features, specifications, and functionality do you offer?
Align each solution directly with its corresponding need.

**- Pain Relievers:** How does your product or service alleviate the
pains identified? Each should be matched to a pain point. **Rank each
effectiveness from 1 (low) to 5 (high).**

**- Rewards:** How does your brand meet emotional desires or create
positive experiences? Align each reward with its matching desire.
**Rate each reward from 1 to 5 for emotional impact.**

**Timing:** Allow another 15 minutes for this exercise. Then:

1\. Have participants place sticky notes in the Your Brand section
across from each corresponding customer insight.

2\. The facilitator consolidates duplicate or similar answers.

3\. As a group, discuss and rate each response's effectiveness on
a scale of 1 (weak) to 5 (excellent).

**Place these sticky notes in their respective sections.**

## Step 3: Evaluate Uniqueness

Now, assess how distinct your brand's responses are compared to those of
your competitors. For each Solution, Pain Reliever, and Reward, score
your brand's uniqueness on a 1 to 5 scale:

1\. Common -- Found everywhere

2\. Slightly different -- Minor edge

3\. Noticeably different -- Moderate differentiation

4\. Highly unique -- Difficult to replicate

5\. One-of-a-kind -- Nearly impossible to copy

On a sticky note, write the uniqueness score beside the corresponding
attribute under the Uniqueness column.

There was a time when being unique was easy. Think of a small town
hardware store. But today, it may be challenging to find your
differentiator.

**The Challenge of Standing Out in a Sea of Sameness**

In today's hyper-competitive world, especially in tech and Software as a
Service (SaaS), differentiating your brand can feel nearly impossible.
Features blur together, benefits sound the same, and every brand shouts
into the void.

If it's tough to articulate what truly sets you apart, it's time to
conduct a competitive brand audit. Take a close look at how your
competitors position themselves. You might discover they're not
emphasizing attributes you *also* offer---attributes that matter to your
customers.

**This presents a powerful opportunity:** you can be the *first* to
**claim that point of difference** in the market.

In the language of *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (2001), the
classic book by Al Ries and Jack Trout:

**"It's better to be first than it is to be better."**2^

Why? Because the first brand to occupy a mental position creates
familiarity. And familiarity is everything to the Old Brain.

The Old Brain---the fast, automatic part of our mind---values
**efficiency, repetition, and consistency**. It doesn't want to
re-evaluate every choice. Once it forms an association (e.g., "this
brand equals fast support" or "this software is the simplest"), it tends
to solidify it.

This is why being first to claim the position matters so much. It's
not just about attention; it's about ownership. The first brand to
occupy a position becomes the "default," and from then on, any
challenger has to work much harder to override what's already filed
away. The Old Brain resists change because **change burns energy**.
Unless there's a compelling reason to reassess, the brain will stick
with what it already knows and trusts.

In other words, **positioning is path-dependent**. If you're the first
to plant your flag, you don't just get there early---you make it harder
for anyone else to move in after you.

If this is the case, consider the following uniqueness scoring on a 1 to
5 scale:

1\. All competitors promote it

2\. Most competitors promote it

3\. Some competitors promote it

4\. Very few or one competitor promotes it

5\. No competitor promotes it

## Step 4: Calculating Your Brand Value Score

To quantify the value of your findings:

1\. Add each attribute's effectiveness score (Step 2) and uniqueness
score (Step 3).

2\. Focus primarily on high-scoring attributes in **Pain Relievers**
and Rewards---these engage the Old Brain and are key to brand
loyalty.

3\. Competing in that area may not be easy if an attribute scores low
in uniqueness (2 or below).

**Tip:** Use high-scoring **Solutions to Needs** as rational
backup---the information the New Brain needs to justify the Old Brain's
emotional decision.

## Step 5: Develop your Brand Promise

Hopefully, by this step, your Brand Promise will begin to crystallize
and become apparent. If there is still ambiguity, you should revisit
your scores and have an honest and open debate. Essentially, you want to
craft only one Brand Promise, so take your time if it does not
become self-evident.

Keep the following top of mind:

1\. A Brand Promise can be one sentence or just a few words.

2\. Your Brand Promise does not necessarily become your hook or
tagline, but all your marketing and positioning should be grounded in
the Brand Promise.

3\. Brand promises rarely change and take time and concerted effort to
become effective. Unfortunately, many companies decide to change their
promise (see Consistency Builds Trust in Chapter 10) before it is
anchored to their target customers.

Here are some compelling Brand Promises from companies you know
well---each one a clear, memorable pledge that emotionally resonates
(Old Brain) and carries rational ballast (New Brain):

**1. Nike**

**- Promise:** "If you have a body, you are an athlete."

**- Tagline:** "Just Do It."

**- Old Brain:** Empowers everyone to see themselves as athletes.

**- New Brain:** Performance‑driven footwear and apparel for all
levels.

**2. Coca‑Cola**

**- Promise:** "To inspire moments of optimism and uplift."

**- Tagline:** "Open Happiness."

**- Old Brain:** Sparks joy, nostalgia, and togetherness.

**- New Brain:** Consistently refreshing flavour, reliable quality
worldwide.

**3. Airbnb**

**- Promise:** "Belong anywhere."

**- Tagline:** "Belong Anywhere."

**- Old Brain:** Promises connection, adventure, and the comfort of
home.

**- New Brain:** A global network of vetted listings with easy booking
and support.

**4. Trader Joe's**

**- Promise:** "Unique products, great prices, and friendly service."

**- Tagline:** "Your Neighbourhood Trader Joe's."

**- Old Brain:** Feels like a personal, community‑centric grocery
discovery.

**- New Brain:** Carefully curated items, competitive pricing, and
helpful staff.

**Practical Tips:**

- Clearly define next-step actions, responsible team members, and
deadlines directly on the canvas.

- Revisit and revise the canvas regularly---especially when launching
a new campaign, entering a new market, or refreshing your brand.

## Wrapping it Up

Completing the Brand Value Canvas isn't just an exercise in
strategy---it's a way to decode what truly drives your customers. By
mapping emotional motivators, rational validators, and your unique
differentiators, the canvas helps you build a brand that speaks to both
gears of the mind: the instinctive Old Brain and the analytical New
Brain.

It brings clarity, collaboration, and action to your branding efforts,
ensuring that your message not only makes sense but also evokes a
genuine emotional response. When your brand promise is aligned with how
humans are wired to think and choose, it's like shifting into the right
gear at the right time---smoother traction, greater momentum, and far
less resistance.

# **Chapter 15: Conclusion: Bridging Minds and Brands**

**"Vision without execution is hallucination."**

Thomas Edison

Congratulations if you've made it from page one to here---you now carry
a mental compass that few people ever fully develop. Most only glimpse
it in passing: those fleeting "Why did I just do that?" moments that
vanish before they can be unpacked. But you've done more than
glimpse---you've traced the wiring. Together, we've followed the
circuitry from our ancient survival engine, the gut-driven Old Brain, to
the modern dashboard of the analytical New Brain.

We've seen how this dual system powers everything: from marketing
pitches and boardroom debates to impulse buys, family decisions, and
even late-night social scrolls. Every choice is a tug-of-war between
instinct and intellect, speed and deliberation, comfort and curiosity.
These forces live in two tightly linked but fundamentally different
gears---one automatic and fast, the other manual and effortful.

But insight without application is just a map left in the glovebox. It
looks nice, but it doesn't take you anywhere. Knowledge only proves its
worth when it changes how you move through the world.

## What We Learned Through Two Lenses

Before we part ways, let's shift from insight to action. Consider the
next couple of pages your field guide---something to reopen when you
need to recalibrate, refocus, or convince a room full of skeptics that
human behaviour makes a lot more sense when you understand the Divided
Brain.

## Five Real‑World Playbooks

**[1. Brand Building]**

***Old Brain*:** Lead every campaign with a human desire---status,
freedom, belonging, mastery---before you mention features.

***New Brain*:** Support that desire with data ---performance metrics,
comparative studies, and transparent pricing.

**- Action Tip**: Audit your brand annually using a Brand Value
Canvas. Include your team and even customers. Review and update
quarterly. Ensure that every team member and new hire understands that
this is the bedrock of your brand.

[**2.** **Product Innovation**]

***Old Brain*:** Prototype experiences first---what the user will *feel*
at each micro‑moment.

***New Brain*:** Layer feasibility, cost models, and road‑map logic
after the emotional arc is clear.

**- Action Tip**: Hold a "day-in-the-life storyboard" session. Walk
through what a user *feels* at each moment, not just what they do.
Using sticky notes or sketches, map emotional highs (such as relief
and joy) and lows (like confusion and frustration). This engages the
Old Brain, ensuring your product connects emotionally before shifting
into New Brain mode to evaluate feasibility, cost, and timelines. Let
the emotional arc guide the logic.

[**3.** **Team Leadership**]

***Old Brain*:** Rituals, recognition, and a shared "why" beat
spreadsheets every time.

***New Brain*:** Clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), transparent
feedback loops, and documented processes prevent chaos.

**- Action Tip**: For every hard metric you introduce---like a revenue
target or KPI---pair it with a soft ritual that engages the Old Brain.
Think team shout-outs, Friday "win walls," or stand-up praise. These
emotional touchpoints boost belonging and motivation, while the New
Brain stays focused on structure and progress. Together, both brains
stay engaged and aligned.

[4. **Sales & Negotiation**]

***Old Brain*:** Build rapport; mirror body language; uncover personal
stakes.

***New Brain*:** Present options, ROI tables, and risk mitigations in a
logical sequence.

**- Action Tip**: Begin your sales deck with a concise, emotionally
resonant vignette---ideally, a real customer success story that
mirrors your prospect's challenges. This activates the Old Brain,
building instant rapport and relevance. Only after the emotional
connection is made should you shift gears into New Brain mode. Lead
with the heart, close with the numbers.

[5[.] **Critical Thinking**]

***Old Brain*:** Notice visceral cues---tight shoulders, feelings of
excitement or dread. They're data.

***New Brain*:** Run a quick "bias scan": Am I anchoring? Am I
loss‑averse? What info is missing?

**- Action Tip**: Set aside 15 minutes a day---perhaps while
journaling or winding down before bed---to **shift gears
intentionally** and strengthen your critical thinking muscle. Ask
yourself:

◦ Was any of the information I encountered today possibly shaped by
bias on the part of the source?

◦ In my conversations, did I unintentionally let any of my biases
steer the discussion?

◦ Did I actively seek out, consider, or even briefly explore a
perspective that challenges my own?

**Don't Forget This**

If there's one final truth to underline, it's this: the most powerful
ideas don't just enter short-term memory---they **anchor in long-term
recall**. Your New Brain handles working memory like a desktop, juggling
details for brief moments. However, the Old Brain, with its emotional
resonance and pattern recognition, determines what gets stored
long-term. That transfer---from conscious awareness to lasting
memory---is where **real influence** resides.

## Mind the Ethical Edge

**Power without ethics is just a more sophisticated form of
manipulation.**

Throughout this book, we've learned how easily the Old Brain can be
steered and how smoothly the New Brain can be lulled into
post-rationalizing almost anything. That knowledge is a gift, but also a
razor. The same insight that lets a health-care campaign nudge people
toward life-saving screenings can, in the wrong hands, push voters
toward disinformation or children toward compulsive spending in a game.

As AI-driven targeting, deepfake video, and real-time sentiment analysis
race ahead, the ethical line is no longer distant; it runs directly
beneath our feet. One wrong step and persuasion becomes predation.

**A Gear-Friendly Code of Conduct:**

**- Empower, not coerce.** Use scarcity cues sparingly and honestly.

**- Elevate, not exploit.** Play to identity and emotion without
resorting to stereotypes or stoking fear.

**- Disclose, don't disguise.** Transparency around AI, sponsorships,
and algorithms builds trust.

**- Balance both gears.** Emotion first, but always followed by
reason.

**- Audit continuously.** Ethics deserves the same rigour as finance.

**The Trust Dividend**

Brands and leaders who prioritize ethics earn something beyond
conversion: *trust*. And trust has a measurable payoff---lower churn,
higher lifetime value, and reputational resilience. The Old Brain may
crave deals, but it values *safety* above all else. When customers feel
you respect their autonomy, they reward you with loyalty that an
algorithm can't game.

In short: every nudge, every story, every dopamine spike is a scalpel.
Use it to heal, not harm---and the market will repay you with longevity,
not just quarterly results.

## The Divided Brain and AI

We are in the midst of a transformation, driven by **the rapid rise of
AI** across nearly every industry. Its influence on marketing, branding,
and consumer behaviour is already staggering. By the time you read this,
AI will likely be outperforming even the savviest marketers in
leveraging---and, unfortunately, exploiting---the very concepts explored
in this book.

Take something as subtle as **Netflix's autoplay**. A 2024 University of
Chicago field experiment found that turning autoplay off reduced
viewing time by **18 minutes per session**.1^ That micro-pause, where
the New Brain might ask, *"Do I really want to watch another episode?"*,
disappears. The Old Brain stays in the driver's seat, and inertia wins.

AI chatbots add another layer. A 2024 e-commerce study of 800
shoppers found that sites using AI-powered assistants saw a 20% rise in
median order values **in just one month**.2^ The reason? "Pre-purchase
perks" and seemingly *personal* conversations that created comfort and
rapport. These interactions weren't human, but the Old Brain couldn't
tell---or didn't care.

Then there's Replika, the AI "companion" app that mimics empathy. It
remembers your name, past chats, and even shares confessions like \*"I
feel anxious too sometimes."3^ Users reciprocate, rating the AI as more
authentic, despite knowing it isn't real. Our Old Brain, wired for
tit-for-tat bonding, struggles to recognize that the warmth is
programmed.

AI will continue to find new ways to **bypass critical thinking**---to
sidestep the small gear and spin the larger one with unnerving
efficiency.

The only real defence is metacognition. Press the clutch and put the
New Brain in gear. Then pause to ask, "Am I being influenced?"
**Awareness is protection.**

## A Parting Invitation

The Divided Brain is not a trick. It's a mirror. And if this book has
done its job, that mirror reflects more than just your customer's mind.
It reflects your own.

Whether shaping a pitch, leading a team, launching a brand, or facing a
2 a.m. crisis of confidence, this model gives you tools to decode what's
happening beneath the surface.

- Listen to the whisper of intuition---but validate with evidence.

- Use emotion to open the door---and reason to keep it standing.

- Craft messages that feel right *and* think right.

Do this consistently, and you won't just build stronger brands; you'll
also develop stronger relationships, a more ethical organization, and a
more straightforward path through the noise of modern life.

Thank you for joining me in exploring Earth's most complex and
fascinating system: the human brain, divided and as a whole.

# Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts

**Adrenaline (Epinephrine):** A hormone and neurotransmitter released in
response to stress or excitement, triggering the \"fight-or-flight\"
response by increasing heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and blood
sugar levels for immediate energy. (Chapter 8)

**Agency:** The idea that a person, being, or force is acting with
purpose or intention. When we detect agency, we believe something
happened because *someone meant for it to happen*, not by accident or
chance. (Chapter 6)

**Altruism:** Selfless concern for the well-being of others, often
involving acting to benefit others without expectation of personal
reward. (Chapter 9)

**Anchoring Bias:** A cognitive bias where an individual relies too
heavily on an initial piece of information (the \"anchor\") when making
decisions. Subsequent judgments are often made by adjusting away from
that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information
around the anchor. (Chapter 6)

**Archetypes (Jungian):** Universal, primordial images and ideas that
are part of the collective unconscious, as theorized by Carl Jung. In
branding, these represent fundamental human motivations and personality
types (e.g., Hero, Sage, Outlaw) that brands can embody to create deeper
connections with consumers. (Chapter 12)

**Authority Bias:** The tendency to attribute greater accuracy and
influence to the opinion of an authority figure (or someone perceived as
an authority), often leading to deference to their judgments and
instructions, regardless of the content. (Chapter 6)

**Bandwagon Fallacy:** A logical fallacy that argues a claim is true or
a course of action is good simply because many people believe it or are
doing it. (Chapter 6)

**Behavioural Economics:** A field of study that combines psychology and
economics to explore how psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural,
and social factors affect the economic decisions of individuals and
institutions. (Chapter 1)

**Brand Promise:** The unique value or experience that a brand
consistently offers to its customers. It\'s the core commitment that
differentiates a brand in the customer\'s mind, encompassing emotional
resonance, rational validation, and distinctive differentiation.
(Chapter 14)

**Brand Value Canvas:** A strategic tool introduced in this book to help
businesses analyze customer insights (needs, pains, desires) and align
their brand\'s responses (solutions, pain relievers, rewards) to develop
a compelling and unique Brand Promise. (Chapter 14)

**Choice Architecture:** The design of different ways in which choices
can be presented to consumers, and the impact of that presentation on
consumer decision-making. (Chapter 13, related to Nudging)

**Cognitive Biases:** Systematic patterns of deviation from the norm or
rationality in judgment. They are often studied in psychology and
behavioural economics and represent mental shortcuts (heuristics) that
can lead to errors in thinking. (Chapter 6)

**Cognitive Dissonance:** The mental discomfort experienced by a person
who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, or when
their beliefs and actions contradict one another. This discomfort leads
to a motivation to change one of the conflicting elements to reduce the
dissonance. (Chapter 6)

**Cognitive Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that people
use to make judgments and decisions quickly and efficiently, especially
in complex situations or when facing incomplete information. (Chapter 3,
Chapter 6)

**Commitment Bias:** A cognitive bias where individuals or groups
continue to invest time, money, or effort in a decision or course of
action they have already made, even when new evidence suggests it is not
the best path, often to justify their prior investment. (Chapter 6)

**Confabulation:** A memory error defined as the production of
fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the
world, without the conscious intention to deceive. The New Brain may
create plausible but untrue explanations to fill in gaps in memory or to
maintain a coherent self-narrative. (Chapter 6, Chapter 5)

**Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favour,
and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one\'s
preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. (Chapter 6)

**Cortisol:** A steroid hormone produced in response to stress. It plays
a role in regulating a wide range of processes throughout the body,
including metabolism and the immune response, but chronically elevated
levels can be detrimental. (Chapter 8)

**Creator Archetype:** A brand archetype that embodies imagination,
innovation, and self-expression, driven to create things of enduring
value and bring visions to life. (Chapter 12)

**Critical Thinking:** The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue
in order to form a judgment. It involves questioning assumptions,
evaluating evidence, identifying biases, and considering alternative
perspectives through New Brain metacognition. (Chapter 7)

**Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance Effect):** A cognitive bias where
consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two
options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically
dominated. The decoy option is priced to make one of the other options
more attractive. (Chapter 6)

**Divided Brain Metaphor:** The central concept of this book represents
human thinking as an interplay between two interconnected \"gears\": the
\"Old Brain\" (larger, faster, emotional, subconscious) and the \"New

behavioural or expressive response. They act as primary motivators and
filters for decision-making. (Chapter 8)

**Empathy:** The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
person. (Chapter 9)

**Endorphins:** Neurotransmitters produced by the body that act as
natural painkillers and can induce feelings of pleasure or well-being,

examines cognition and behaviour from a modern evolutionary perspective.
It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved
adaptations. (Chapter 1)

**Explorer Archetype:** A brand archetype driven by the desire for
freedom, discovery, and authenticity, encouraging individuals to explore
the world and themselves. (Chapter 12)

**Fairness (Sense of):** An innate or learned expectation of just and
equitable treatment, which can influence reactions to perceived
injustices or imbalances. (Chapter 4)

**False Cause Fallacy (Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc):** A logical fallacy
that occurs when it is assumed that because one event follows another,
the first event must have caused the second. (Chapter 6)

**False Dilemma Fallacy (Either/Or Fallacy):** A logical fallacy that
presents only two options or sides when there are many options or sides.
(Chapter 6)

**Familiarity (Preference for):** A psychological phenomenon where
people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are
familiar with them. The Old Brain often craves the familiar for comfort
and predictability. (Chapter 4, Chapter 10)

others are experiencing something rewarding or exclusive without you.
It's at the root of the Scarcity Bias and compels action to avoid regret
or social loss. (Chapter 6)

based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative
connotations; e.g., as a loss or as a gain. (Chapter 13)

**Fundamental Attribution Error:** A logical fallacy and cognitive bias
where people tend to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore
situational factors in judging others\' behaviour, while often doing the
opposite when explaining their own behaviour. (Chapter 6)

**Guilt by Association Fallacy:** A logical fallacy where a person or
idea is rejected because of its association with something negative,
rather than on the merits of the person or idea itself. (Chapter 6)

impression of a person, company, brand, or product influences the
observer\'s feelings and thoughts about that entity\'s character or
properties. (Chapter 6)

humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness
despite major positive or negative events or life changes. (Chapter 9)

**Hero Archetype:** A brand archetype characterized by courage,
determination, and a desire to prove one\'s worth through challenging
deeds, often overcoming obstacles and protecting others. (Chapter 12)

**Hero\'s Journey:** A common narrative archetype, or story template,
identified by Joseph Campbell, that involves a hero who goes on an
adventure, learns a lesson, wins a victory with that newfound knowledge,
and then returns home transformed. (Chapter 11)

**Hindsight Bias (I-knew-it-all-along phenomenon):** The tendency, after
an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable,
despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting
it. (Chapter 6)

**Hyperactive Agency Detection (HAAD):** A cognitive bias where we
assume an intentional being is behind events, even when there's no clear
cause. This evolved to help us survive potential threats, but today it
contributes to belief in gods, spirits, fate, and conspiracy theories.
(Chapter 6)

**Immediate Gratification:** The desire to experience pleasure or
fulfillment without delay or deferment. The Old Brain often prioritizes
immediate rewards over long-term benefits. (Chapter 4)

functions, including emotion, behaviour, motivation, long-term memory,
and olfaction. Often associated with the Old Brain in the Divided Brain
metaphor. (Chapter 2)

**Logical Fallacies:** Flaws in reasoning that weaken an argument or
render it invalid. They are errors in the structure of an argument, as
opposed to errors in its factual content. (Chapter 6)

individuals, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as
powerful as the pleasure of gaining. (Chapter 6)

**Lover Archetype:** A brand archetype that focuses on intimacy,
passion, and connection, valuing relationships and sensory pleasure.

true and create transformative experiences, often through vision,
innovation, or a touch of mystery. (Chapter 12)

**MAYA Principle (Most Advanced, Yet Acceptable):** A design philosophy
by Raymond Loewy suggesting that consumers are torn between a curiosity
for new things and a fear of anything too new. Successful designs strike
a balance by being advanced enough to be intriguing but familiar enough
to be acceptable. (Chapter 10)

**Metacognition:** Awareness and understanding of one\'s own thought
processes; \"thinking about thinking.\" A key capability of the New
Brain is that it allows for self-reflection, questioning assumptions,
and correcting errors in thinking. (Chapter 5, Chapter 7)

**MySide Bias (In-Group Bias):** The tendency for people to favour
information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or values, and to
give preferential treatment to people they perceive to be members of
their own group. (Chapter 6)

**Neocortex:** The newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve,
involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception,
cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, and
language. Represents the \"New Brain\" in the Divided Brain metaphor.
(Chapter 2)

**Neuroscience:** The scientific study of the nervous system, including
the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, and its impact on behaviour and
cognitive functions. (Chapter 1)

**Neurons:** Specialized cells in the nervous system that transmit
information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. They are the
basic working units of the brain. (Chapter 2)

**Neurotransmitters:** Chemical messengers that transmit signals across
a chemical synapse, such as from one neuron (nerve cell) to another
target neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell. (Chapter 8)

**New Brain:** In the Divided Brain metaphor, the smaller, slower,
conscious, and logical part of the brain is responsible for rational
thought, planning, language, and metacognition. Corresponds roughly to
the neocortex and Kahneman\'s System 2. (Chapter 2, Chapter 5)

**Novelty (Preference for, in small doses):** While the Old Brain craves
familiarity, humans also have a curiosity for new things. The New Brain
is often engaged by novelty, but too much can be overwhelming. (Chapter
4, Chapter 10)

**Nudging:** A concept in behavioural science, political theory, and
economics which argues that positive reinforcement and indirect
suggestions to try to achieve non-forced compliance can influence the
motives, incentives, and decision making of groups and individuals, at
least as effectively -- if not more effectively -- than direct
instruction, legislation, or enforcement. (Chapter 13)

**Occam\'s Razor:** A problem-solving principle stating that among
competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be
selected. Simpler explanations are generally preferable to more complex
ones, all else being equal. (Chapter 7)

**Old Brain:** In the Divided Brain metaphor, the larger, faster,
subconscious, emotional, and instinctual part of the brain is
responsible for survival, snap judgments, and automatic responses.
Corresponds roughly to the reptilian brain and limbic system, and
Kahneman\'s System 1. (Chapter 2, Chapter 3)

**Outlaw Archetype:** A brand archetype that embodies rebellion,
revolution, and a desire to disrupt the status quo, often challenging
conventions and advocating for radical freedom. (Chapter 12)

hormone\" or \"bonding hormone,\" released during social bonding,
trust-building, and moments of connection. (Chapter 8)

**Patternicity:** The Old Brain's tendency to find meaningful patterns

the scientific method. It lacks empirical evidence, rigorous testing,
and often relies on anecdotal evidence or unfalsifiable claims. (Chapter
7)

mind, where the \"Rider\" (conscious, controlled thought; New Brain)
attempts to guide the \"Elephant\" (emotions, intuition, automatic
processes; Old Brain). (Chapter 2)

**Ruler Archetype:** A brand archetype that embodies control,
leadership, and responsibility, striving to create order, stability, and
prosperity. (Chapter 12)

**Sage Archetype:** A brand archetype driven by the pursuit of truth,

**Slippery Slope Fallacy:** A logical fallacy in which a party asserts
that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events
culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. (Chapter 6)

**Social Proof Bias:** A psychological and social phenomenon wherein
people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behaviour
in a given situation. Also known as informational social influence.
(Chapter 6)

**Special Pleading:** A form of fallacious argument where someone
attempts to cite something as an exception to a generally accepted rule
or principle without justifying the exception. In the context of this
book, the New Brain rationalizes Old Brain decisions. (Chapter 5)

**Storytelling:** The art of conveying events in words, images, and
sounds, often improvisationally or with embellishment. A powerful tool
for engaging both the Old and New Brains by creating emotional
connections and providing memorable frameworks. (Chapter 11)

**Straw Man Fallacy:** A logical fallacy that occurs when someone takes
another person\'s argument or point, distorts it or exaggerates it in
some kind of extreme way, and then attacks the extreme distortion, as if
that is really the claim the first person is making. (Chapter 6)

**Sunk Cost Bias (Sunk Cost Fallacy):** The phenomenon whereby a person
is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have
invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be
more beneficial. (Chapter 6)

**System 1 Thinking (Kahneman):** Fast, automatic, intuitive, and
unconscious mode of thinking. Corresponds to the Old Brain. (Chapter 2)

**System 2 Thinking (Kahneman):** Slow, deliberate, analytical, and
conscious mode of thinking. Corresponds to the New Brain. (Chapter 2)

**Testosterone:** A hormone primarily associated with male development,
but present in all genders, influencing traits like competitiveness,
dominance, and libido. (Chapter 8)

Triune Brain Model (MacLean): Paul MacLean\'s model divides the human
brain into three distinct regions: the reptilian complex (instincts),
the paleomammalian complex/limbic system (emotions), and the
neomammalian complex/neocortex (rational thought). (Chapter 2)
